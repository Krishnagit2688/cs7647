Sandeep Bakhshi:
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q3 of FY2021. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra,
Rakesh and Anindya.
Thank you all for joining us today. We hope that you are safe and in good health. India has
embarked on what we hope would be the last stage of its fight against the Covid-19
pandemic with the launch of the nationwide vaccination drive. We would like to extend
our gratitude to the relentless efforts of the medical and research fraternity, healthcare
staff and all essential service providers who have helped to put up a strong fight against
Covid-19. I would also like to take a moment here to thank our employees for their service
to customers in these challenging times.
The Bank’s Economic Research Group’s proprietary Ultra Frequency Index, which
comprises several high frequency indicators, reached a record high of 106.3 for the week
ending January 17. The index has remained above 100 for the last four weeks indicating
that economic activity has crossed pre-COVID levels. Several high frequency indicators
such as rural unemployment rates, rail freight revenues, power consumption, e-way bill
generation and electronic toll collections were above the pre-Covid levels consistently in
the last four weeks. The month of December registered the highest ever monthly
collections of GST primarily on the back of festive season sales and rise in collections on
imports. The record agricultural output across kharif and rabi seasons last year, steady rise
in rabi crop sowing in the current season and increase in tractor sales point towards a
strong rural economy. There has also been an uptick in property registrations in December
compared to September.
These trends are also reflected in the business and results of ICICI Bank, as we continue to
steadily grow our business, within our well-defined framework.

1. Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the
focused pursuit of target market segments
The core operating profit increased by 14.8% year-on-year to 80.54 billion Rupees in Q3
of 2021. The profit after tax increased by 19.2% year-on-year to 49.40 billion Rupees in Q3
of 2021 from 41.46 billion Rupees in Q3 last year.
2. Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Deposit growth continued to be strong, with 22.1% year-on-year growth in total deposits
at December 31, 2020. During the quarter, average current account deposits increased by
26.5% year-on-year and average savings account deposits by 15.9% year-on-year. The
liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was 146%, reflecting significant surplus liquidity.
Our cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system. Our 360-degree
customer coverage, digital platforms and efforts towards process decongestion have
played an important role in the growth of our deposit franchise.
3. Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward
The continued pickup in economic activity and tailwinds from the festive season,
combined with the Bank’s digital initiatives and extensive franchise reflected in an increase
in disbursements across retail products during this quarter. Mortgage disbursements
increased further in this quarter over the previous quarter driven by our efforts to offer a
convenient and frictionless experience to customers by digitising the entire underwriting
process, with instant loan approvals. Disbursements of auto loans have continued to
increase from the September levels and have crossed pre-Covid levels in December. Till
January 27, 2021, we have disbursed about 120 billion Rupees under the ECLGS 1.0
scheme and about 6 billion Rupees has been disbursed under the ECLGS 2.0 scheme. The
overall retail loan portfolio grew by 15.4% year-on-year and 6.8% sequentially. The growth
of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was 9.6% year-on-year and 8.5%
sequentially. Overall, the domestic loan portfolio grew by 13.3% year-on-year and 7.5%
sequentially. The overseas branches portfolio and within that, the non-India linked
Page 3 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
corporate portfolio, declined both year-on-year and sequentially in line with the approach
which we have articulated earlier.
4. Leveraging digital across our business
We have continued to reimagine existing digital journeys in order to decongest service
delivery and enhance the customer experience. The ICICI STACK helps us to curate and
offer hyper-personalised solutions to our customers suiting their life-stage and business
needs. During this quarter, we expanded our state-of-the-art mobile banking app, iMobile,
to iMobile Pay which offers payment and banking services to customers of any bank.
iMobile Pay can be used for making payments using UPI and also offers instant banking
services such as opening savings account, investments, loans and credit cards. We have
seen about half a million activations of iMobile Pay from non-ICICI Bank customers since
it was launched just two months ago. We offer bespoke digital solutions for corporate and
institutional customers which enable us to tap into their ecosystems. The steady increase
in adoption of these solutions and fund flows through our digital financial supply chain
and trade platforms have contributed to the growth of our deposit franchise. We have
launched an online platform called ‘Infinite India’ offering not only banking solutions but
also other value added services for foreign companies looking to establish or expand
business in the country.
5. Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
The indicators around economic activities have been positive and this reflects in the trends
of our portfolio. The trends in collections and overdues across loan portfolios continued
to improve during the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Rakesh will expand on this
later.
Loans amounting to 82.80 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020, compared to 14.10 billion
Rupees at September 30, 2020, were not classified as non-performing pursuant to the
Supreme Court’s interim order. In addition, the total fund based outstanding to all
borrowers under resolution as per RBI’s framework, not included in these proforma NPA
numbers, is 25.46 billion Rupees or about 0.4% of the total loan portfolio at December 31,
Page 4 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
2020. These are in line with or better than our expectations of NPA additions and loans
under resolution.
During Q3 of 2021, the Bank made contingency provision amounting to 30.12 billion
Rupees for borrower accounts not classified as non-performing pursuant to the Supreme
Court’s interim order and utilised 18.00 billion Rupees of Covid-19 related provisions made
in earlier periods. Accordingly, the Bank held aggregate Covid-19 related provision of
99.84 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 87.72 billion Rupees at September
30, 2020. This includes contingency provision for proforma NPAs amounting to 35.09
billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 4.97 billion Rupees at September 30,
2020.
On a proforma basis, the provisioning coverage continued to be robust at 77.6% as of
December 31, 2020.
As mentioned in our previous earnings calls, our aim is to be proactive in provisioning
with the objective of ensuring that the balance sheet is robust at all times. We have further
strengthened our provisioning policies on NPAs during this quarter. Our contingency
provisions on proforma non-performing loans during the quarter also takes into account
this revised policy. The provisions during the quarter were higher by about 21 billion
Rupees due to this more conservative approach.
To summarise on asset quality: The provision coverage ratio on a proforma basis is robust.
Less than 90-day overdues above the normal pre-Covid level are substantially lower at
end-December compared to end-September. We are confident that the Covid-19
provisions we hold as of end-December will completely cushion the balance sheet from
potential credit losses which may arise due to the pandemic. As we have stated earlier,
we expect credit costs to normalise in fiscal 2022 based on our current expectations of
economic activity and portfolio trends.
6. Maintaining a strong capital base
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 16.79%
including the profits for nine months of the current fiscal year. This strong capital position
Page 5 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
does not include the market value of the Bank’s investments in listed subsidiaries, of about
764 billion Rupees.
Looking ahead, we see optimism in the economy supported by the indicators of
resumption of economic activity and continued growth in digitisation. We believe our
extensive franchise, high quality digital platforms and solutions, our approach of 360-
degree customer centricity, our prudent risk management practices and our strong capital
ratios put us in a good position to capture opportunities that will arise in the near and
medium term. We will continue to focus on delivering consistent and predictable returns
to our shareholders.
With these opening remarks, I will now hand the call over to Rakesh.
Rakesh Jha:
Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details,
capital adequacy, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.
A. Balance sheet growth
The overall loan portfolio grew by 10.0% year-on-year at December 31, 2020. The
domestic loan portfolio grew by 13.3% year-on-year and 7.5% sequentially at December
31, 2020. The retail portfolio grew by 15.4% year-on-year and 6.8% sequentially. Within
the retail portfolio, the mortgage loan portfolio grew by 15.0% year-on-year, business
banking by 39.4%, rural lending by 24.6%, commercial vehicle and equipment loans by
8.1% and auto loan portfolio by 6.9%. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio
was 9.1%. This portfolio was 636.56 billion Rupees or 9.1% of the overall loan book at
December 31, 2020.
The disbursements in the retail portfolio have increased substantially in Q3 compared to
Q2. Sandeep has already talked about the trends in the mortgages and auto loans
portfolios. While the disbursements in the commercial vehicle and personal loan portfolios
have increased in Q3 compared to Q2, they continue to remain below pre-Covid levels.
Credit card spends have reached pre-Covid levels in December led by increased spends
Page 6 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
in categories such as health & wellness, electronics and e-commerce. These trends
resulted in healthy sequential growth across portfolios.
The SME business comprising borrowers with a turnover of less than 2.5 billion Rupees
grew by 24.6% year-on-year to 270.93 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020.
The growth of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was 9.6% year-on-year and
8.5% sequentially, driven by disbursements to higher rated corporates to meet their
working capital and capital expenditure requirements. While various sectors and corporate
clients contributed to this growth, some focus segments were highly rated PSUs and large
established corporate groups.
The overseas loan portfolio declined by 25.7% year-on-year in US dollar terms at
December 31, 2020. The overseas loan portfolio was 6.2% of the overall loan book at
December 31, 2020. We had mentioned in our previous quarter earnings call that we would
be progressively exiting our non-India linked exposures in a planned manner. The non-
India linked corporate portfolio reduced by 48.0% year-on-year and 14.1% sequentially at
December 31, 2020.
Coming to the funding side: We continue to focus on growing the daily average CASA
balances and retail term deposits. Average savings account deposits increased by 15.9%
year-on-year and average current account deposits increased by 26.5% year-on-year
during the quarter. Total term deposits grew by 26.1% year-on-year to 4.8 trillion Rupees
at December 31, 2020.
B. Credit quality
Loans aggregating to 82.80 billion Rupees, compared to 14.10 billion Rupees at September
30, 2020, were not classified as non-performing at December 31, 2020 pursuant to the
Supreme Court’s interim order. Of the 82.80 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020, 75.21
billion Rupees was from the retail portfolio and 7.59 billion Rupees was from the corporate
and SME portfolio. The reported gross NPA additions during the quarter were 4.71 billion
Rupees.
Page 7 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
Recoveries and upgrades, excluding write-offs, were 17.76 billion Rupees in the current
quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 9.33 billion Rupees from the retail portfolio
and 8.43 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The gross NPAs written-off
during the quarter were 27.36 billion Rupees. The gross NPAs sold during the quarter were
0.88 billion Rupees.
The net non-performing assets were 48.61 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared
to 71.88 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. The gross NPA ratio was 4.38% and the
net NPA ratio was 0.63% at December 31, 2020. The gross NPA ratio on a proforma basis
was 5.42% at December 31, 2020 compared to 5.36% at September 30, 2020. The
proforma net NPA ratio was 1.26% at December 31, 2020 compared to 1.12% at
September 30, 2020.
We had mentioned in our previous quarter’s earnings call that the corporate loans under
resolution via the framework announced by RBI in August would be less than 1% of the
total loan portfolio of the Bank. Excluding proforma NPAs, the total fund based
outstanding to all borrowers under resolution is about 25.46 billion Rupees or about 0.4%
of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Of the above fund based outstanding, 8.37
billion Rupees was from the retail loan portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 3.85 billion
Rupees against these borrowers, which is in excess of the requirement as per RBI
guidelines. Going forward, the asset classification of corporate and SME borrowers under
resolution would depend on the timing of implementation of resolution schemes and
payment performance in the interim. As you are aware that there is time till June 30, 2021
to implement the resolution. Resolution has also been invoked for proforma NPA loans
amounting to 8.88 billion Rupees.
Compared to the normal pre-Covid trend, the percentage of the retail EMI products and
credit card portfolio which was overdue for less than 90 days was about 1.5% higher at
December 31, 2020 compared to about 4% higher at September 30, 2020. The percentage
of the performing rural portfolio which was overdue at December 31, 2020 was about 1.5%
higher than the normal pre-Covid trend compared to about 1% higher at September 30,
2020. The percentage of the SME and business banking portfolio overdue for less than 90
days was similar to the pre-Covid levels at September-end and remains so at December-
end. In the domestic and overseas corporate loan portfolio, less than 2% of the portfolio
Page 8 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
was overdue for less than 90 days at December 31, 2020 compared to less than 3% at
September 30, 2020.
C. P&L Details
Net interest income increased by 16.0% year-on-year to 99.12 billion Rupees. Interest on
income tax refund was 1.96 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 0.26 billion Rupees in
the previous quarter and 0.16 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. We have reversed the
interest accrued on proforma NPAs and the same is reflected in the net interest income
for the current and previous quarter. The net interest margin was at 3.67% in Q3 of 2021
compared to 3.57% in the previous quarter and 3.77% in Q3 of last year. The impact of
interest on income tax refund and interest collections from NPAs was about 11 basis points
this quarter compared to about 3 basis points in the previous quarter and about 10 basis
points in Q3 of last year. The domestic NIM was at 3.78% this quarter compared to 3.72%
in Q2 and 4.04% in Q3 last year. International margins were at 0.34%. The cost of deposits
was 3.97% in Q3 compared to 4.22% in Q2.
Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, declined by 3.0% year-on-year to 39.21
billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021.
 Fee income was 36.01 billion Rupees in Q3. Compared to a decline of 30.8% year-on-
year in Q1 of 2021 and 9.7% year-on-year in Q2 of 2021, fee income grew by 0.1% year-
on-year in Q3 of 2021. The sequential growth in fee income was 14.7% reflecting the
continuing normalisation in customer spending and borrowing activity
 Dividend income from subsidiaries was 3.56 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021 compared to
3.67 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year
On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 3.7% year-on-year in Q3. The
operating expenses increased by 12.6% sequentially. The employee expenses increased
marginally by 0.4% year-on-year. The Bank had 92,103 employees at December 31, 2020.
We expect the employee count to increase during Q4 of 2021. Non-employee expenses
increased by 5.5% year-on-year in Q3 of 2021 due to increase in retail business related
costs and technology related expenses partly offset by decrease in advertisement and
sales promotion expenses. We would expect business related expenses to increase in
Page 9 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
future quarters as business volumes increase further from the current levels. We continue
to make investments in technology and to grow our franchise.
The core operating profit increased by 14.8% year-on-year to 80.54 billion Rupees in Q3
of 2021. The core operating profit grew by 15.9% during 9M of 2021.
The treasury income was 7.66 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 5.42 billion Rupees
in Q2. The treasury income this quarter includes 3.29 billion Rupees from sale of 2.2%
stake in ICICI Securities compared to 3.05 billion Rupees in Q2. These stake sales were
undertaken to meet the minimum public shareholding requirement by March 2021, as
required by applicable regulation.
During Q3 of 2021, the Bank made contingency provision amounting to 30.12 billion
Rupees for proforma NPAs. We utilised 18.00 billion Rupees of Covid-19 related provisions
made in the earlier periods. Accordingly, the Bank held aggregate Covid-19 related
provision of 99.84 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 87.72 billion Rupees
at September 30, 2020. This includes contingency provision for proforma NPAs amounting
to 35.09 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 4.97 billion Rupees at
September 30, 2020. On a proforma basis, the provisioning coverage continued to be
robust at 77.6% as of December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, the total outstanding Covid-19 related provisions, provisions for
non-fund based outstanding to NPAs, general provisions on standard assets and other
standard asset provisions were 164.01 billion Rupees or 2.3% of loans. This includes
contingency provisions of 35.09 billion Rupees on proforma NPAs.
As Sandeep mentioned, we are confident that these provisions will completely cushion
the balance sheet from the potential credit losses which may arise due to the pandemic.
The profit before tax increased by 11.2% to 60.78 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021 compared
to 54.65 billion Rupees in Q3 last year. The tax expense was 11.38 billion in Q3 of 2021
compared to 13.19 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The tax expense
declined due to lower effective tax rate in Q3 of 2021 mainly because of higher gains from
sale of stake in subsidiaries in fiscal 2021 which are not subject to tax. The profit after tax
Page 10 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
grew by 19.2% to 49.40 billion Rupees in Q3 this year compared to 41.46 billion Rupees in
Q3 of last year.
The consolidated profit after tax was 54.98 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 48.82
billion Rupees in Q2 and 46.70 billion Rupees in Q3 last year. The consolidated RoE was
14.6% this quarter.
D. Capital
The CET1 ratio, including profits for 9M of 2021, was 16.79% at December 31, 2020
compared to 16.54% at September 30, 2020. Including profits for 9M of 2021, the Tier 1
ratio was 18.12% and the total capital adequacy ratio was 19.51% at December 31, 2020.
E. Portfolio information
We are focused on growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk
and reward. Our retail is built based on proprietary data and analytics in addition to bureau
checks, and well-priced in relation to the risk. Our strong deposit franchise enables us to
offer competitive pricing to the selected customer segments. We have given further
information on our portfolio in slides 31 to 34 of our investor presentation.
The loans and non-fund based outstanding to corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and
below (excluding proforma NPAs) was 180.61 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020
compared to 161.67 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020, details of which are given on
slide 35 of the investor presentation.
Other than four accounts, two in construction and one each in the telecom and power
sectors, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was
about 6 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020.
On slide 36 of the presentation, we have provided the movement in our BB and below
portfolio during Q3 of 2021. In Q3 of 2021:
Page 11 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
 The rating downgrades from investment grade categories were 22.39 billion
Rupees. The downgrades were largely from the construction sector;
 There was a net decrease in outstanding of 1.45 billion Rupees;
 There was a reduction of 1.50 billion Rupees due to inclusion of some borrowers
in the proforma NPAs and devolvement of 0.77 billion Rupees of non-fund based
outstanding to NPAs; and
 There were upgrades of 0.27 billion Rupees from NPA to below investment grade
categories
Except one lease rental discounting account, all corporate and SME borrowers under
resolution as per RBI’s framework were rated below investment grade at December 31,
2020.
The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans
and working capital loans was 225.57 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 or 3.2% of our
total loan portfolio. As mentioned in our previous calls, our portfolio is granular in nature
with the larger exposures being to well-established builders. About 13% of our builder
portfolio at December 31, 2020 was either rated BB and below internally or was classified
as non-performing.
The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 576.29 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020
compared to 501.31 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. The total outstanding loans to
NBFCs and HFCs were about 6% of our advances at December 31, 2020. The details are
given on slide 38 of the investor presentation. Our exposure is largely to well-rated entities
with PSUs, long vintage, entities owned by banks and well-established corporate groups.
The sequential increase in the outstanding to NBFC and HFCs during the quarter reflects
this. The proportion of the NBFC and HFC portfolio internally rated BB and below or non-
performing is about 1%.
Coming to our overseas portfolio, excluding exposures to financial institutions and retail
lending against deposits, the total corporate fund and non-fund outstanding of overseas
branches, net of cash or bank or insurance backed lending, was 5.20 billion US dollars at
December 31, 2020 compared to 5.47 billion US dollars at September 30, 2020 and 8.62
billion US dollars at December 31, 2019. 69% of the outstanding at December 31, 2020
Page 12 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
was to Indian corporates and their subsidiaries and joint ventures. 16% of the outstanding
was to non-India companies with Indian or India-linked operations and activities. The
portfolio in this segment is well-rated and the Indian operations of these companies are
target customers for the Bank’s deposit and transaction banking franchise, and we would
continue to pursue risk-calibrated opportunities in this segment. 6% of the outstanding
was to companies owned by NRIs or PIOs. 9% of the outstanding was to other non-India
companies which is less than 1% of the total portfolio of the Bank.
F. Subsidiaries
The details of the financial performance of subsidiaries is covered in slides 43-44 and 63-
68 in the investor presentation.
Value of new business of ICICI Life was 10.30 billion Rupees in 9M of 2021 The new
business margin increased from 21.7% in fiscal 2020 to 26.0% in 9M of 2021. The new
business margin was 25.7% this quarter. The protection based annualised premium
equivalent was 7.03 billion Rupees and accounted for 17.8% of the total annualised
premium equivalent in 9M of 2021. The new business premium was 78.99 billion Rupees
in 9M of 2021.
Gross Direct Premium Income of ICICI General increased by 9.2% year-on-year to 40.34
billion Rupees in Q3 of this year compared to 36.93 billion Rupees in Q3 last year. The
combined ratio improved to 97.9% in Q3 of 2021 compared to 98.7% in Q3 of 2020. The

billion Rupees in Q3 last year.
The profit after tax of ICICI AMC was 3.58 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared
to 3.05 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year.
The profit after tax of ICICI Securities, on a consolidated basis, was 2.67 billion Rupees in
the current quarter compared to 1.37 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year.
ICICI Bank Canada had a profit after tax of 5.1 million Canadian dollars in the current quarter
which was at a similar level compared to Q2 and 22.1 million Canadian dollars in Q3 of
Page 13 of 35ICICI Bank Ltd
January 30, 2021
2020. The profit after tax was higher in Q3 of 2020 due to recoveries from India-linked
impaired corporate loans. The loan book of ICICI Bank Canada at December 31, 2020
declined by 7.5% year-on-year and 3.7% sequentially.
ICICI Bank UK had a profit after tax of 2.2 million US dollars this quarter compared to 8.0
million US dollars in Q3 of last year and 4.9 million US dollars in Q2 of 2021. The loan book
of ICICI Bank UK at December 31, 2020 declined by 28.9% year-on-year and 11.6%
sequentially.
ICICI Home Finance had a profit after tax of 0.03 billion Rupees in the current quarter which
was at a similar level compared to Q3 of last year.
With this we conclude our opening remarks and we will now be happy to take your
questions.
