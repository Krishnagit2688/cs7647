Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q2 of FY2022. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra,
Rakesh and Anindya.
We hope that you are safe and in good health. India has witnessed a steady decline in
Covid-19 cases and a massive pickup in the vaccination programme since June. India has
now crossed the milestone of administering 100 crore vaccination doses. We would like
to extend our gratitude to the efforts and dedication of all health workers and essential
service providers for their untiring efforts in the recovery from the pandemic. I would also
like to take a moment to thank our employees for their service to customers in these
challenging times. We are happy to share that now almost all our employees have received
at least one dose of the vaccine.
Economic activity has continued to improve since June. The Ultra Frequency Index,
comprising several high frequency indicators tracked by the Bank’s Economic Research
Group, has steadily increased from 99.6 in the first week of July 2021 to 105.5 in
September 2021 and reached 110.3 in the week ending October 17. The underlying
economic activity continues to show an upward momentum owing to higher peak power
demand, e-way bill generation and rail freight revenues, improved vehicle registrations on
the back of the festive season, and rising labour force participation rate in urban areas.
Overall industrial activity is above pre Covid-19 levels. The progress in the vaccination
programme is supporting an improvement in mobility indicators. We expect the festive
season to give further impetus to economic activity.
During the challenging period of the last 18 months, we at ICICI Bank have continued to
strengthen our franchise and delivery and servicing capabilities, with a range of digital
initiatives. Our loan portfolio has performed well in the face of the challenges posed by the
two waves of the pandemic, behaving either in line with or better than our expectations.
We aim to create holistic value propositions for our customers through our 360-degree
customer-centric approach and focus on opportunities across client and segment
ecosystems. Cross-functional teams have been created to tap into key customer and
market segments, enabling 360-degree coverage of customers and increase in wallet

share. We will continue to steadily grow our business and franchise within our strategic
framework.
Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:
1. Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the
focused pursuit of target market segments
The core operating profit increased by 23.3% year-on-year and 10.6% sequentially to
95.18 billion Rupees in this quarter. The profit after tax grew by 29.6% year-on-year
and 19.4% sequentially to 55.11 billion Rupees in this quarter.
2. Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Growth in deposits continued to be strong at 17.3% year-on-year at September 30,
2021. During the quarter, average current account deposits increased by 35.7% year-
on-year and average savings account deposits by 24.9% year-on-year. The liquidity
coverage ratio for the quarter was 133%, reflecting continued surplus liquidity. Our
cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system.
3. Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward
The retail loan portfolio grew by 20.0% year-on-year and 5.0% sequentially at
September 30, 2021. With the increase in economic activity, disbursements across all
retail products increased sequentially in this quarter. Mortgage disbursements were
close to the level seen in Q4 of 2021, reflecting the increase in demand coupled with
our seamless customer onboarding experience through pre-approved offers and
digitisation. Disbursements of personal loans and auto loans were also close to Q4 of
2021 levels. Credit cards in force increased by 6.0% sequentially and the value of
credit card spends grew by 47.0% sequentially. Spends across most categories other
than travel crossed March 2021 levels in September. We expect the momentum in
spends to continue in the festive season.

October 23, 2021
The business banking and SME portfolios grew by 43.1% year-on-year and 42.0%
year-on-year respectively. Sequentially, the business banking portfolio grew by
12.3% and the SME portfolio grew by 11.3%. We are observing a steady uptick in the
number of credit enquiries and with our digital offerings and platforms like InstaBIZ,
Merchant Stack and Trade Online, we believe that there is significant potential for
growth across these portfolios.
Excluding the builder portfolio, the growth in the domestic corporate portfolio was
about 14% year-on-year at September 30, 2021.
Overall, the domestic loan portfolio grew by 19.0% year-on-year and 4.0%
sequentially.
4. Leveraging digital across our business
Our digital platforms are continuously evolving to enable best-in-class end-to-end
seamless digital journeys, offer personalized solutions and value added features to
customers and enable more effective data-driven cross-sell and up-sell. These
platforms also enable us to acquire new customers. We have shared some details in
slides 18 to 30 of the investor presentation.
We have seen significant increase in adoption of our mobile banking app, iMobile Pay.
There were about 1.5 million activations from non-ICICI Bank account holders in the
current quarter, taking the total activations to 4 million as of end-September. The
transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders in terms of value and volume
respectively were three times and thirteen times higher in September 2021 compared
to June 2021. We are seeing a rapid rise in payment transactions through repeat use
of features such as ‘Pay to Contact’ and ‘Scan to Pay’.
We continue to expand the suite of services offered through iMobile Pay to achieve
high engagement levels with users. Recently, we launched a facility which enables
our savings account holders to manage dues of credit cards of any bank through
iMobile Pay. We also launched a contactless payment facility on iMobile Pay which
Page 4 of 32ICICI Bank
October 23, 2021
enables users of android based smartphones to make credit and debit card payments
on POS terminals in a safe and secure manner by tapping their phones.
The financial transactions on our digital platform for businesses, InstaBIZ, and our
supply chain platforms have grown steadily in the past few quarters. The value of
financial transactions on InstaBIZ grew by about 80% year-on-year in Q2 of 2022. We
have onboarded about 200 corporate customers on our supply chain platforms.
About 70% of the dealers of these customers are active on our supply chain
platforms. The value of transactions through these platforms increased 4.7 times year-
on-year in Q2 of 2022.
The proportion of end-to-end digital sanctions and disbursements across various
products has been increasing steadily. About 32% of our mortgage sanctions and
40% of our personal loan disbursements, by volume, were end-to-end digital in H1 of
2022. About 95% of the overdraft facilities set up for business banking current account
customers were end-to-end digital in H1 of 2022. 40% of asset and liability accounts
opened during the quarter were through digital channels.
An important element of our strategy to grow our risk-calibrated core operating profit
is to serve the complete financial requirements of customers and their ecosystems.
The ICICI STACK for corporates is being continuously enhanced. We have created 19
industry specific STACKs which provide bespoke and purpose-based digital solutions
to corporate clients and their ecosystems. The volume of transactions through these
solutions grew 2.4 times year-on-year in Q2 of 2022. These solutions along with the
depth of our coverage have supported the strong growth in our average current
account deposits. Further, the Bank is well positioned to capture the opportunities
arising from the growing FDI and capital market flows.
We are focusing holistically on the merchant ecosystem, both directly and through
partnerships. Our Super Merchant current account which offers various benefits such
as digital account opening and instant overdraft facilities based on point-of-sale
transactions has been receiving a good response from customers. We have partnered
with Amazon India to offer instant overdraft to sellers, including non-ICICI Bank
customers, on its portal. We have also launched an instant overdraft facility for
Page 5 of 32ICICI Bank
October 23, 2021
MSMEs registered on the GEM Sahay application through API integration with the
OCEN network.
5. Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
Net NPAs declined by 12.3% sequentially to 81.61 billion Rupees at September 30,
2021 from 93.06 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021. The net NPA ratio declined to 0.99%
at September 30, 2021 from 1.16% at June 30, 2021. The net additions to gross NPAs
during the quarter were 0.96 billion Rupees. The total provisions during the quarter
were 27.14 billion Rupees or 28.5% of core operating profit and 1.44% of average
advances. The provision coverage ratio on NPAs was 80.1% at September 30, 2021.
The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers under resolution as per
various guidelines was 96.84 billion Rupees or about 1.3% of the total loan portfolio
at September 30, 2021. The Bank holds provisions of 19.50 billion Rupees against
these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines. In
addition, the Bank continues to hold Covid-19 provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees or
about 0.8% of total loans as of September 30, 2021.
6. Maintaining a strong capital base
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.33%
at September 30, 2021, including profits for H1 of 2022. Further, the market value of
the Bank’s investments in listed entities of the Group is about 1 trillion Rupees.
Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to grow our core operating profit in a risk
calibrated manner. Using ICICI STACK, we will create digital journeys and offer
personalized and customized solutions to the customers to suit their life-stage and
business needs. We will continue to build flexibility and agility in the Bank to tap into
opportunities across ecosystems. We believe that our ongoing investments in technology,
people and distribution network, our prudent risk management practices and our strong
balance sheet will enable us to drive growth in our core operating profit in a risk-calibrated
manner. We continue to be guided by our philosophy of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank”,
emphasising the need to deliver fair value to customers while creating value for
Page 6 of 32ICICI Bank

shareholders. We will continue to focus on delivering consistent and predictable returns
to our shareholders.

last year. The domestic NIM was at 4.09% this quarter compared to 3.99% in Q1 and 3.72%
in Q2 last year. International margins were at 0.26%. The cost of deposits was 3.53% in
Q2 compared to 3.65% in Q1. The sequential increase in NIM in this quarter was primarily
due to decline in cost of funds and lower interest reversals on NPAs.
Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 26.2% year-on-year to 44.00
billion Rupees in Q2 of 2022
 Fee income increased by 21.4% year-on-year to 38.11 billion Rupees in Q2. Fees
from retail, business banking and SME customers grew by 24.6% year-on-year
and constituted about 77.9% of the total fees in this quarter.

in this quarter compared to 3.34 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year. The dividend
income this quarter includes final dividend of ICICI General and higher final

reflecting the low base of Q2 last year. The employee expenses increased by 21.2% year-
on-year. The Bank had slightly over 100,000 employees at September 30, 2021. The
employee count has increased by about 8,000 in the last 12 months. Employee expenses
in Q2 include an impact of about 1.25 billion Rupees due to fair valuation of ESOPs granted
to all employees post April 1, 2021 for the current and previous quarter as required by RBI
guidelines. Non-employee expenses increased by 32.3% year-on-year in this quarter
primarily due to retail business and technology related expenses. We will continue to
invest in technology, people, distribution and building our brand.

95.18 billion Rupees in this quarter.

operating profit and 1.44% of average advances. There was no writeback of Covid-19
related provisions during the quarter. The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be

provisions on borrowers under resolution and Covid-19 related provisions of 64.25 billion
Rupees. The Covid-19 provisions are about 0.8% of loans. At September 30, 2021, the total
provisions, other than specific provisions on NPAs, were 149.51 billion Rupees or 2.0% of

completely cushion the balance sheet from the potential credit losses which may arise due
to the pandemic.

E. Portfolio information
We have been growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward. Our retail portfolio has been built based on proprietary data and analytics in
addition to bureau checks, utilising the existing customer database for sourcing in key
retail asset products through cross sell and up-sell and pricing in relation to the risk. In the
business banking and SME business, our focus is on parameterised and programme based
lending, granularity, collateral and robust monitoring. Credit summations in the overdraft
accounts of business banking and SME customers have continued to grow consistently in
this quarter and reached March 2021 levels in September. We have given further
information on our retail and business banking portfolio in slides 37 to 47 of our investor
presentation.
The loan and non-fund based outstanding to performing corporate and SME borrowers
rated BB and below was 127.14 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021 compared to 139.75
billion Rupees at June 30, 2021 and 119.29 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. The
details are given on slide 39 and 40 of the investor presentation.
Similar to the last quarter, other than three accounts, one each in construction, power and
telecom sectors, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio
was less than 6 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2021, we held

Rupees at June 30, 2021.
The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans
and working capital loans was 228.14 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021 or 3% of our

well-established builders. About 13% of our builder portfolio at September 30, 2021 was
either rated BB and below internally or was classified as non-performing.
F. Subsidiaries and key associates

of this year compared to 99.8% in H1 last year. The profit after tax was 4.46 billion Rupees

numbers.

billion Rupees in Q2 of last year reflecting the growth in AUM.

ICICI Bank Canada had a profit after tax of 8.4 million Canadian dollars in this quarter
compared to 5.1 million Canadian dollars in Q2 last year and 5.0 million Canadian dollars
in the previous quarter. The sequential increase in profit after tax of ICICI Bank Canada is

30, 2021 declined by 8.8% year-on-year.

quarter compared to 0.02 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year and 0.17 billion Rupees in the

With this we conclude our opening remarks and we will now be happy to take your
questions.
