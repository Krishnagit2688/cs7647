Thank you. The next question is from the line of Prakhar Agrawal from Edelweiss. Please
go ahead. As, there is no response from the current participant. We move on to the next
question from the line of Adarsh Parasrampuria from CLSA. Please go ahead.
Adarsh Parasrampuria:
Just one question on the ROE expectation. In the last 12-18 months it was quite volatile.
We are getting comfortable with credit cost and the operating profit trajectories been quite
strong. Any, targets in ROE for the Bank over the next two to three years?
Rakesh Jha:
Adarsh as you know we don’t have any specific target communicated on ROE. We’ll repeat
that our focus is to grow our risk calibrated core operating profit, and if that happens the
ROE should improve. We have seen some improvement over the last 12-24 months and
that would be the objective going forward as well. There is no specific target that we have
for ROE in our mind.
Adarsh Parasrampuria:
Rakesh, one question on the leveraging up of the balance sheet. On our growth being
strong our ROEs will get there and we did raise capital in the pandemic anticipating some
issues, but the outcomes have been a lot better. So, where does leverage go in the balance
sheet in the next two to three years, because given that the ROEs will go up, it doesn’t look
like we’ll have a lot of leveraging up of the balance sheet?
Rakesh Jha:
We will see that in terms of opportunities. It’s going to be a function of what is the market
opportunity and within that what fits into our risk and return criteria. We are at a very
healthy level of capital, so that gives us confidence that we can capitalize on all the
opportunities which would come up and we are pretty optimistic about the economy,

about the opportunity for the banking system in the two to three year timeframe that you’re
referring to. Based on the opportunities we will see how the leverage goes up from the
current levels.
