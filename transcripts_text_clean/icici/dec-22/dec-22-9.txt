The last question is from the line of M.B. Mahesh from Kotak Securities.
M. B. Mahesh:
Two questions. One, if you just kind of call out, are you still seeing recoveries coming in
from previously written-off accounts? And if that is moving still favourably in your
provisioning lines?
Page 17 of 19Anindya Banerjee:
Yes, we have seen some recoveries coming in from the older NPLs that were then provided
or may be partly written off and that has contributed to the lower provisions or actually, if
you look at for this quarter, excluding the impact of the change in norms and the
contingency provision, we have a net write-back of about INR 4.4 billion. We have seen
one or two large corporate recoveries.
M.B. Mahesh:
If you keep interest rates where they are today, when does cost of funds start hitting as
you go forward? And if yes, how should we model over the next few quarters on this
number?
Anindya Banerjee:
It is difficult for me to say how you should model it. But my guess is that it should start
showing up to some extent in Q4 and more so in Q1.
M.B. Mahesh:
And how much of headroom you have available on the yield side, if interest rates are
where they are today?
Anindya Banerjee:
We would have for Q4, the December hike will play out over Q4 for us.
M.B. Mahesh:
And you're saying that the peak cost of funds starts hitting you from Q1 of next year?
Anindya Banerjee:
Yes, it will happen over a period of time. And of course, the balance sheet doesn't remain
static in that sense. We also have some ability to manage assets and liabilities, investment
portfolio and so on.
