Next question is from the line of Saurabh from JPMorgan.
Saurabh:
Sir, two questions. One is through this quarter end LCR. And the second is, can you explain
this provisioning tightening you have done in your corporate and SME business?
Anindya Banerjee:
We have not reported the quarter end LCR, the reporting is on a quarterly average basis,
but I would say it would be broadly at similar levels. The trajectory that liquidity follows is
typically pretty strong at month end, then during the month, deposit withdrawals happen,
say on the savings side, in particular quarters there are advance tax outflows and so on
when the system goes tight on liquidity and then it builds up again. That's why we look at
the average but the quarter end would not be materially different from the reported
number of 123% average for the quarter.
On the provisioning policy the RBI norms prescribe a minimum provisioning policy and on
the retail and rural loans, we already follow a more conservative provisioning norm where
we provide for NPAs on a more accelerated basis. For the corporate, SME and business
banking portfolio we were applying the RBI norm and we thought that it would be prudent
to do some acceleration there as well, both in terms of the period over which we reach
100% coverage and also in the earlier buckets.
Saurabh:
Sir, on your card spend market share, how you're thinking about it?
Anindya Banerjee:
We are focused on growing the profitable high-quality market share. I think we have seen
a decline in our commercial card market share over the last couple of quarters in terms of
spend but we are quite happy with the way our retail card spends are shaping up. Not
targeting a particular level of market share overall but just looking at higher quality spend
growth and that is broadly moving in line with what we would wanted to.
