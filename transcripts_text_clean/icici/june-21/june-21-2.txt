Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q1 of FY2022. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra,
Rakesh and Anindya.
We hope that you are safe and in good health. The second wave of the Covid-19
pandemic was more severe compared to the first wave in terms of cases and fatalities,
and a wider geographic reach. As banking is classified as an essential service, most of
our branches were open even during the months of April and May when containment
measures were in place in various parts of the country. Our colleagues have shown
resilience and strength and continued to serve our customers, even in this challenging
environment when a number of our colleagues were themselves impacted by the virus.
We are happy to share that now about 80% of the Bank’s employees have received at
least one dose of vaccination against Covid-19. We would like to thank the medical and
health workers and other essential workers for their tireless efforts in this fight against
Covid-19.
With the decline in the numbers of Covid-19 cases since June, there has been a gradual
easing of restrictions across various states. The Ultra Frequency Index, comprising
several high frequency indicators tracked by the Bank’s Economic Research Group,
which declined from 107.9 in March to 70.9 in May has improved to 99.6 in the first week
of July. High frequency indicators such as power demand, e-way bill generation and the
unemployment rate have shown significant improvement in June. Vehicle registrations
have also improved in June compared to April and May. Going forward the pace of
normalisation in economic activities will depend on the trajectory of the pandemic, the
level of containment measures in place and the pace and effectiveness of vaccination.

At ICICI Bank, we continue to steadily grow our franchise and maintain our strong
balance sheet.
1. Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
the focused pursuit of target market segments
Our aim is to achieve risk-calibrated growth in core operating profit through a 360-
degree customer centric approach, tapping opportunities across ecosystems,
leveraging internal synergies, building partnerships and decongesting processes.
The core operating profit increased by 22.7% year-on-year to 86.05 billion Rupees in
Q1 of 2022. The profit after tax grew by 77.6% year-on-year to 46.16 billion Rupees
in Q1 of 2022.
2. Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Total deposits grew by 15.5% year-on-year to 9.3 trillion Rupees at June 30, 2021.
During the quarter, average current account deposits increased by 32.4% year-on-
year and average savings account deposits by 21.7% year-on-year. Term deposits
grew by 8.7% year-on-year. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was 130%,
reflecting continued significant surplus liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to
be among the lowest in the system. Our digital platforms and solutions, presence
in various ecosystems and process decongestion initiatives have played an
important role in the growth of our deposit franchise.
3. Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward
Retail disbursements moderated in April and May due to the containment measures
in place across various parts of the country. With the gradual easing of restrictions,
disbursements picked up in June and July. Credit card spends declined in April and
May but improved to March levels in June, driven by spends in categories like
consumer durables, utilities, education and insurance. The retail loan portfolio,
excluding business banking, grew by 20.2% year-on-year and was flat sequentially
at June 30, 2021.
Page 3 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
Credit summations in the overdraft accounts of business banking and SME
customers also picked up in June and July after declining in April and May. Our
business banking and SME franchises continue to grow on the back of digital
offerings and platforms like InstaBIZ and Trade Online. The business banking and
SME portfolios grew by 53.4% and 42.8% year-on-year respectively. The business
banking portfolio grew by 6.3% sequentially and the SME portfolio saw a marginal
sequential decline.
The growth of the domestic corporate portfolio was 11.4% year-on-year. The
growth in performing domestic corporate portfolio, excluding the builder portfolio,
was about 15% year-on-year at June 30, 2021. Overall, the domestic loan portfolio
grew by 19.6% year-on-year and was flat sequentially. The non-India linked
overseas corporate portfolio, declined year-on-year and sequentially, in line with
the approach which we have articulated earlier.
4. Leveraging digital across our business
Our open architecture based digital platforms provide end-to-end seamless digital
journeys and personalized solutions to customers and enable more effective data-
driven cross-sell and up-sell. These platforms also enable us to reach out to non-
ICICI Bank account holders. We have shared some details in slides 17 to 28 of the
investor presentation.
We have seen significant increase in adoption of our mobile banking app, iMobile
Pay, with over 2.5 million activations by non-ICICI Bank account holders since its
launch six months ago. The transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders in terms
of value and volume have grown by eight times and seven times, respectively, in
June 2021 compared to March 2021.
The financial transactions on our digital platform for businesses, InstaBIZ, and our
supply chain platform have grown steadily in the past few quarters. The increasing
adoption of our digital platforms and growth in the value and volume of transactions
supports growth in CASA deposits and provides a rich base for analytics and cross-
sell. The value of financial transactions through InstaBIZ more than doubled year-
Page 4 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
on-year in Q1 of 2022. The value of transactions through supply chain platforms
grew by more than 8 times year-on-year in June 2021.
We have taken a number of initiatives to offer a convenient and frictionless
experience to customers by digitising the credit underwriting process, with instant
loan approvals. The proportion of end-to-end digital sanctions and disbursements
across various products has been increasing steadily. About 34% of our total
mortgage sanctions by volume were end-to-end digital in Q1 of 2022 compared to
19% FY2021. About 46% of personal loan disbursements by volume were end-to-
end digital in Q1 of 2022 compared to 42% in FY2021. Of the total asset and liability
accounts opened as well as third party products sold during June, about 40% was
end-to-end digital. About 95,000 customers were onboarded using video KYC in
June 2021.
We continue to strengthen our position in the digital payments ecosystem by
building seamless user journeys, facilitating higher transaction throughputs and
driving repeat transactions. Our strategy is to participate both directly through our
own platforms and partner with third party players in the P2P and P2M space of the
UPI ecosystem. We are seeing high customer engagement through repeat usage of
features like Pay to Contact, Scan to Pay and bill payments on iMobile Pay. The
volume of transactions through ‘Pay to Contact’ has grown by over five times in Q1
of 2022 over Q4 of 2021. The value of UPI P2M transactions more than doubled
year-on-year and grew by over 30.0% sequentially in Q1 of 2022.
We have recently launched a digital platform called Merchant Stack, which offers
an array of banking and value-added services to retailers, online businesses and
large e-commerce firms such as digital current account opening, instant overdraft
facilities based on point-of-sale transactions and instant settlement of point-of-sale
transactions, among others. We also introduced ICICI STACK for Corporates which
is a comprehensive set of digital banking solutions for corporates and their entire
ecosystem of promoters, employees, dealers, and vendors. These solutions enable
corporates to seamlessly meet all banking requirements of their ecosystems in a
frictionless manner.

July 24, 2021
We continue to invest in technology to enhance our offerings to customers as well
as the scalability, flexibility and resilience of our technology architecture. We
actively monitor and improve our technology infrastructure to minimise disruptions
in services to our customers. As a part of our #2025 technology strategy, we are
creating an enterprise architecture framework spanning digital platforms, data and
analytics, micro services based architecture, cloud computing and other emerging
technologies.
5. Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
The measures imposed by authorities in various parts of the country to contain the
spread of the second wave of the pandemic had a significant impact on collections
and recoveries in April and May. We sought to adopt a sensitive approach to the
difficulties faced by our customers and prioritised their health and safety as well as
that of our employees. Unlike last year, regulatory dispensations such as
moratorium were not available to borrowers this time. This has led to an increase
in overdues and gross NPA additions in Q1 of 2022 for the banking system,
including us. The gross NPA additions during the quarter were 72.31 billion Rupees,
of which 67.73 billion Rupees was from the retail and business banking portfolio.
The retail and business banking gross NPA additions included additions of 11.30
billion Rupees from the jewel loan portfolio. Jewel loan is a fully secured product
and the loss given default in this portfolio is negligible. In order to be sensitive to
the difficulties faced by customers and give them time for repayment, we have
delayed sending the auction notices to customers in default. We expect near
complete recoveries from this portfolio in the coming quarters.
As mentioned in our previous earnings calls, our aim is to be proactive in
provisioning with the objective of ensuring that the balance sheet is robust at all
times. We have further strengthened our provisioning policies on NPAs during this
quarter. The provisions during the quarter were higher by 11.27 billion Rupees due
to this more conservative approach. The provision coverage ratio on NPAs was
78.2% at June 30, 2021.
Page 6 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
Based on its current assessment of the portfolio, the Bank has written back 10.50
billion Rupees of Covid-19 related provisions created in earlier periods. As of June
30, 2021, the Bank held Covid-19 provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees which are about
0.9% of our total loans.
The overdues in the performing portfolio across various segments were either
marginally higher than pre-Covid levels or at pre-Covid levels at the end of March
2021. These increased in April and May due to the second wave of the pandemic
and related restrictions. With the easing of restrictions and pickup in economic
activity in June, the overdues across various segments of the performing portfolio
have declined. We expect further improvement in collections and decline in
overdues in the coming quarters.
In the absence of regulatory measures such as moratorium, the gross NPA
formation due to the recent wave of Covid-19 is being upfronted in the first half of
the current fiscal for the system, including us. Based on our current expectations of
economic activity and portfolio trends, we expect our gross NPA additions to be
lower in Q2 of 2022 and decline more meaningfully in the second half of fiscal 2022.
There would also be some additions to the loans under resolution as per the various
frameworks announced by RBI.
We have a robust provision coverage ratio on NPAs and in addition we hold Covid-
19 related provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees, or about 0.9% of our total loans, to
address potential future credit losses arising out of the pandemic and its economic
impact. The performance of the portfolio and the strength of the balance sheet give
us significant comfort.
6. Maintaining a strong capital base
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.01%
at June 30, 2021, including profits for the quarter. Further, the market value of the
Bank’s investments in listed subsidiaries is about 1 trillion Rupees.
Page 7 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to grow the core operating profit in a risk-
calibrated manner. We will calibrate our growth in the near term based on the operating
environment and the future trajectory of the Covid-19 pandemic. We will continue to
focus on creating holistic value propositions for our customers and capturing
opportunities across customer ecosystems, leveraging internal synergies, building
partnerships and simplifying processes. We have a wide physical distribution network
and our best-in-class digital platforms provide seamless onboarding and transacting
experience for our customers. We have opened eight ecosystem branches that house
multi-functional teams required to nurture relationships and bring the entire bouquet of
services of the Bank to the corporates and their ecosystem. We will continue to make
investments in technology, people, distribution and building our brand. We are guided
by our philosophy of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank” emphasising the need to deliver
fair value to customers while creating value for shareholders. We will continue to focus
on delivering consistent and predictable returns to our shareholders.
With these opening remarks, I will now hand the call over to Rakesh.
Rakesh’s opening remarks
Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details,
capital adequacy, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.
A. Balance sheet growth
The overall loan portfolio grew by 17.0% year-on-year at June 30, 2021. The domestic
loan portfolio grew by 19.6% year-on-year and 0.3% sequentially at June 30, 2021. Up
to the last quarter, we used to report business banking as a part of the retail portfolio.
From this quarter, we are excluding it from the retail portfolio and reporting it separately.
The retail portfolio grew by 20.2% year-on-year and 0.7% sequentially. Within the retail
portfolio, the mortgage loan portfolio grew by 24.0% year-on-year, rural loans by 24.2%,
commercial vehicle and equipment loans by 1.5% and the auto loan portfolio by 15.0%.
Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 13.5% year-on-year. This
portfolio was 666.26 billion Rupees or 9.0% of the overall loan book at June 30, 2021.
Page 8 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
The business banking portfolio grew by 53.4% year-on-year and 6.3% sequentially at
June 30, 2021. The SME business comprising borrowers with a turnover of less than 2.5
billion Rupees grew by 42.8% year-on-year and decreased by 1.7% sequentially to
297.78 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021.
The growth of the domestic corporate portfolio was 11.4% year-on-year. The growth in
performing domestic corporate portfolio, excluding the builder portfolio, was about 15%
year-on-year at June 30, 2021 driven by disbursements to higher rated corporates and
PSUs across various sectors to meet their working capital and capital expenditure
requirements.
The overseas loan portfolio declined by 14.7% year-on-year and increased by 6.7%
sequentially at June 30, 2021. The sequential increase in the overseas loan portfolio was
primarily due to increase in the India-linked trade finance book. The overseas loan
portfolio was 5.4% of the overall loan book at June 30, 2021. The non-India linked
corporate portfolio reduced by 58.8% or about 1.4 billion US Dollars year-on-year and
21.6% or about 270 million US Dollars sequentially, at June 30, 2021. We have provided
the breakup of our overseas corporate portfolio on slide 16 of the investor presentation.
Coming to the funding side: We continue to focus on growing the daily average CASA
balances and retail term deposits. Average savings account deposits increased by 21.7%
year-on-year and average current account deposits increased by 32.4% year-on-year
during the quarter. There could be some impact on the sequential growth in current
account deposits in the next quarter due to the implementation of RBI’s guideline on
opening of current accounts by banks. Total term deposits grew by 8.7% year-on-year
to 5.0 trillion Rupees at June 30, 2021.
B. Credit quality
The gross NPA additions were 72.31 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to
55.23 billion Rupees on a proforma basis in Q4 of 2021. Recoveries and upgrades from
NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 36.27 billion rupees which was about 50.0%
of the gross NPA additions during the quarter. The gross NPA additions from the retail
and business banking portfolio were 67.73 billion Rupees in the current quarter
Page 9 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
compared to 43.55 billion Rupees on a proforma basis in Q4 of 2021. The retail and
business banking gross NPA additions included additions of 9.61 billion Rupees from the
kisan credit card portfolio and 11.30 billion Rupees from the jewel loan portfolio. As
Sandeep mentioned earlier, we expect near complete recoveries from the jewel loan
portfolio in the coming quarters. We typically see gross NPA additions from kisan credit
card portfolio in the first and third quarter of the fiscal year. The gross NPA additions
from the kisan credit card portfolio were relatively low last year due to moratorium
extended to the borrowers from March to August. The kisan credit card portfolio and
jewel loan portfolio were about 3% each of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2021. In
the retail and business banking gross NPA additions, excluding rural, the proportion of
mortgages was similar to FY2021, commercial vehicle and equipment loans was higher
and personal loans and credit cards was lower.
The gross NPA additions from the corporate and SME portfolio were 4.58 billion Rupees
in the current quarter compared to 11.68 billion Rupees on a proforma basis in Q4 of
2021. Proforma corporate and SME NPA additions in the previous quarter included one
account in the construction sector which was rated BB and below at December 31 and
was classified as non-performing during Q4 and upgraded in the same quarter post the
implementation by all lenders of a resolution plan as per RBI’s framework.
Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 36.27 billion
Rupees. There were recoveries and upgrades of 22.64 billion Rupees from the retail and
business banking portfolio and 13.63 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME
portfolio. The recoveries and upgrades in the corporate and SME portfolio during Q1 of
2022 mainly represent a few accounts which were upgraded post the implementation of
a resolution plan as per RBI’s framework, by all lenders. The gross NPAs written-off
during the quarter were 15.89 billion Rupees. The Bank sold gross NPAs amounting to
2.40 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022 on a cash basis. The gross NPAs sold during the quarter
were entirely from the corporate and SME portfolio.
The net non-performing assets were 93.06 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021 compared to
91.80 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021. The gross NPA ratio was 5.15% at June 30, 2021
compared to 4.96% at March 31, 2021. The net NPA ratio was 1.16% at June 30, 2021
compared to 1.14% at March 31, 2021. The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers
Page 10 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
classified as non-performing was 41.01 billion Rupees as of June 30, 2021 compared to
44.05 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 16.55
billion Rupees as of June 30, 2021 on this non-fund based outstanding.
The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers, under resolution as per
various guidelines was 48.64 billion Rupees or about 0.7% of the total loan portfolio at
June 30, 2021 compared to 39.27 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021. Of the total fund
based outstanding at June 30, 2021, 21.80 billion Rupees was from the retail and
business banking portfolio and 26.84 billion Rupees was from the corporate and SME
portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 8.99 billion Rupees against these borrowers,
which is in excess of the requirement as per RBI guidelines.
The overdues across various portfolios increased in April and May due to the reasons
which Sandeep highlighted earlier. With the easing of restrictions from June, collections
and recoveries have improved and overdues have declined. We had mentioned in our
previous quarter’s earnings call, that overdues in the performing portfolio across retail
EMI products and credit cards, SME and business banking portfolio were either
marginally higher or at pre-Covid levels at March 31, 2021. The percentage of overdues
in the performing portfolio across most of these segments at June-end was similar to or
lower than December 2020 levels. Less than 1% of the performing domestic corporate
portfolio was overdue at June-end. As Sandeep mentioned, we expect further
improvement in collections and decline in overdues in the coming quarters.
C. P&L Details
Net interest income increased by 17.8% year-on-year to 109.36 billion Rupees. Interest
on income tax refund was 0.14 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 0.11 billion
Rupees in the previous quarter and 0.24 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year. The net interest
margin was at 3.89% in Q1 of 2022 compared to 3.84% in the previous quarter and
3.69% in Q1 of last year. The impact of interest on income tax refund and interest
collections from NPAs was about 2 basis points this quarter compared to about 4 basis
points in the previous quarter and in Q1 of last year. The domestic NIM was at 3.99%
this quarter compared to 3.94% in Q4 and 3.91% in Q1 last year. International margins
were at 0.27%. The cost of deposits was 3.65% in Q1 compared to 3.80% in Q4.
Page 11 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 55.7% year-on-year to 37.06
billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022 primarily due to base effect.
 Fee income increased by 53.0% year-on-year to 32.19 billion Rupees in Q1.
Fees from retail, business banking and SME customers grew by 65.4% year-
on-year and constituted about 76% of the total fees in Q1 of 2022. Total fee
income declined by 15.6% sequentially reflecting the decline in investment
and borrowing activity by customers during the quarter.
 Dividend income from subsidiaries was 4.10 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022
compared to 1.87 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year. Dividend income in Q1 of
this year includes final dividend from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.
On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 29.9% year-on-year in Q1. The
employee expenses increased by 9.6% year-on-year and by 18.2% sequentially. The
Bank had slightly over 100,000 employees at June 30, 2021. Non-employee expenses
increased by 47.7% year-on-year in Q1 of 2022 primarily due to base effect. The non-
employee expenses declined by 8.3% sequentially due to lower business volumes
during the quarter, partly offset by, technology related expenses.
The core operating profit increased by 22.7% year-on-year to 86.05 billion Rupees in Q1
of 2022.
There was a treasury gain of 2.90 billion Rupees in Q1 compared to a loss of 0.25 billion
Rupees in Q4 and a gain of 37.63 billion Rupees in Q1 of the previous year. Treasury
gains in Q1 of previous year included gains of 30.36 billion Rupees from sale of stake in
ICICI Life and ICICI General.
The total net provisions during the quarter were 28.52 billion Rupees. We have further
strengthened our provisioning policies on NPAs during this quarter. The provisions
during the quarter were higher by 11.27 billion Rupees due to this more conservative
approach.
During the quarter, the Bank wrote back 10.50 billion Rupees of Covid-19 related
provisions created in earlier periods. This was based on the updated position of various
Page 12 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
portfolios underlying these provisions, after taking into account the NPAs already
accounted for and specific provisions held against the same, as well as potential future
credit losses arising out of the pandemic and its economic impact.
The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 78.2% as of June 30, 2021.
In addition, we continue to hold Covid-19 related provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees,
which is about 0.9% of loans. We are confident that these provisions will completely
cushion the balance sheet from the potential credit losses which may arise due to the
pandemic. The performance of the portfolio and the strength of the balance sheet give
us significant comfort.
The profit before tax grew by 89.8% year-on-year to 60.43 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022
compared to 31.83 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year. The tax expense was 14.27 billion
Rupees in Q1 of 2022 compared to 5.84 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last
year. The profit after tax grew by 77.6% year-on-year to 46.16 billion Rupees in Q1 this
year compared to 25.99 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year.
The consolidated profit after tax was 47.47 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 48.86
billion Rupees in Q4 and 31.18 billion Rupees in Q1 last year.
D. Capital
The CET1 ratio, including profits for Q1 of 2022 was 17.01% at June 30, 2021 compared
to 16.80% at March 31, 2021. The Tier 1 ratio was 18.24% and the total capital adequacy
ratio was 19.27% at June 30, 2021.
E. Portfolio information
We have been growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward. Our retail portfolio has been built based on proprietary data and analytics in
addition to bureau checks, utilising the existing customer database for sourcing in key
retail asset products through cross sell and up-sell and pricing in relation to the risk. Our
strong deposit franchise enables us to offer competitive pricing to the selected customer
segments. As Sandeep mentioned, disbursements across key retail products declined in
April and May. However, these recovered in June and trends in July also appear
Page 13 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
promising. We continuously monitor the performance at a sub-segment level and
recalibrate the customer selection and underwriting norms in view of the current
operating environment so as to leverage the demand while operating within our risk
appetite. The Bank had calibrated its credit filters and underwriting norms following the
outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. With the gradual unlock and subsequent
recovery observed, some rollback of the measures were carried out. The Bank reviewed
the same in view of the second wave of Covid-19 and considering the measures already
place, no significant further action was deemed necessary. However, due to the evolving
environment, policy rationalization measures are being continuously taken as per our
analysis of various micro segments.
We have given further information on our retail and business banking portfolio in slides
34 to 45 of our investor presentation.
The loan and non-fund based outstanding to corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and
below (excluding fund and non-fund based outstanding to NPAs) was 139.75 billion
Rupees at June 30, 2021 compared to 130.98 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021, details
of which are given on slide 37 of the investor presentation. Other than three accounts,
one each in construction, power and telecom sectors, the maximum single borrower
outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at June 30,
2021. At June 30, 2021, we held provisions of 9.76 billion Rupees on the BB and below
portfolio compared to 3.32 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021.
On slide 38 of the presentation, we have provided the movement in our BB and below
portfolio during Q1 of 2022. The increase during the quarter primarily reflects a few
accounts which were upgraded post the implementation of a resolution plan as per RBI’s
framework.
Except for fund based outstanding of project under implementation accounts in the
commercial real estate sector amounting to about 3 billion Rupees, all corporate and
SME borrowers under resolution were rated below investment grade at June 30, 2021
The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans
and working capital loans was 230.05 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021 or 3% of our total
loan portfolio. As mentioned in our previous calls, our portfolio is granular in nature with
Page 14 of 38ICICI Bank Ltd
July 24, 2021
the larger exposures being to well-established builders. About 13% of our builder
portfolio at June 30, 2021 was either rated BB and below internally or was classified as
non-performing.
The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 593.67 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021
compared to 645.09 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021. The total outstanding loans to
NBFCs and HFCs were about 7% of our advances at June 30, 2021. The details are given
on slide 44 of the investor presentation. Our exposure is largely to well-rated entities
with PSUs, long vintage, entities owned by banks and well-established corporate groups.
The proportion of the NBFC and HFC portfolio internally rated BB and below or non-
performing is less than 1%.
F. Subsidiaries
The details of the financial performance of subsidiaries is covered in slides 49-50 and 69-
