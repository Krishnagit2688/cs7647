Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q2 of FY2023. Joining us today on this call are Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh,
Anindya and Abhinek.
The Indian economy has seen a robust recovery from challenges posed by pandemic.
However, we are currently experiencing volatility in the global economy and financial
markets, geo political tensions and upward movements in inflation, interest and exchange
rates. The authorities have been taking various measures to address the evolving situation.
At ICICI Bank, we aim to grow the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
a 360-degree customer-centric approach and by focusing on ecosystems and micro-
markets. We continue to operate within our strategic framework and strengthen our
franchise, enhance our delivery and servicing capabilities and expand our technology and
digital offerings.
Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:
First- Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
the focused pursuit of target market segments
The core operating profit increased by 23.6% year-on-year to 117.65 billion Rupees in this
quarter. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries and associates, core operating profit
grew by 24.4% year-on-year. The profit after tax grew by 37.1% year-on-year to 75.58
billion Rupees in this quarter.
Second-Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Total period-end deposits grew by 11.5% year-on-year at September 30, 2022. During

savings account deposits grew by 16.0% year-on-year. Period-end term deposits grew
by 10.5% year-on-year and 4.3% sequentially at September 30, 2022. The liquidity
coverage ratio for the quarter was about 127%.
Page 2 of 22Third-Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk
and reward
The retail loan portfolio grew by 24.6% year-on-year and 6.0% sequentially at September
30, 2022. Including non-fund based outstanding, the retail portfolio was 44.2% of the total
portfolio. The business-banking portfolio grew by 42.6% year-on-year and 10.8%
sequentially. The SME portfolio grew by 26.5% year-on-year and 6.4% sequentially. The
growth in SME and business banking portfolios was driven by leveraging our branch
network and digital offerings such as InstaBIZ and Merchant Stack. The domestic corporate
portfolio grew by 23.1% year-on-year and 6.8% sequentially at September 30, 2022 driven
by growth across well-rated financial and non-financial corporates. The rural portfolio grew
by 11.7% year-on-year and 3.8% sequentially. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 24.0%
year-on-year and 6.0% sequentially. The overall loan portfolio grew by 22.7% year-on-year
and 4.8% sequentially at September 30, 2022.
Fourth-Leveraging digital across our business
We continue to enhance our digital offerings and platforms to onboard new customers in
a seamless manner and provide them end-to-end digital journeys and personalised
solutions. These platforms also enable us to do cross sell and up sell. We have shared
some details on our technology and digital offerings in slides 17 to 27 of the investor
presentation.
Fifth - Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
The net NPA ratio declined to 0.61% at September 30, 2022 from 0.70% at June 30, 2022
and 0.99% at September 30, 2021. During the quarter, there were net additions of 6.05
billion Rupees to gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale. The provisioning coverage
ratio on NPAs was 80.6% at September 30, 2022. The total provisions during the quarter
were 16.44 billion Rupees or 14.0% of core operating profit and 0.71% of average
advances. This includes contingency provision of 15.00 billion Rupees made on a prudent
basis. The Bank holds contingency provisions of 100.00 billion Rupees or about 1.1% of
total loans as of September 30, 2022.
Page 3 of 22Sixth- Maintaining a strong capital base

1 ratio of 17.51% and total capital adequacy ratio of 18.27% at September 30, 2022,
including profits for H1-2023.
Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on growing the core operating profit in a risk-
calibrated manner. We will work as one team by facilitating cross-functional collaboration
to tap into key customer and market segments, enabling 360-degree coverage and
increase in wallet share. We will continue to make investments in technology, people,
distribution and building our brand. The principles of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank” and
“One Bank, One Team, One RoE” will guide our operations. We focus on building a culture
where every employee in the Bank serves customers with humility and upholds the values
of brand ICICI. We aim to be the trusted financial services provider of choice for our
customers and deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders.
I now hand the call over to Anindya.
Anindya’s opening remarks
Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details,
growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.
A. Balance sheet growth
Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Coming to the growth across
retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 20.4% year-on-year and 4.4% sequentially.
Auto loans grew by 19.0% year-on-year and 5.2% sequentially. The commercial vehicles
and equipment portfolio grew by 5.6% year-on-year and 0.6% sequentially. Growth in the
personal loan and credit card portfolio was 48.8% year-on-year and 11.8% sequentially.
This portfolio was 1,077.49 billion Rupees or 11.5% of the overall loan book at September
30, 2022.
The overseas loan portfolio, in US dollar terms, declined by 10.4% year-on-year and 19.4%
sequentially at September 30, 2022. The decline in overseas book primarily reflects
maturities of the short-term India-linked trade book. The overseas loan portfolio was about
4.0% of the overall loan book at September 30, 2022. The non-India linked corporate
portfolio declined by 47.4% or about 387 million US dollars on a year-on-year basis. Of the
overseas corporate portfolio, about 84% comprises Indian corporates, 7% is overseas
Page 4 of 22corporates with Indian linkage, 4% comprises companies owned by NRIs or PIOs and
balance 5% is non-India corporates.
On the liabilities side, Sandeep covered the growth in deposits. During the quarter, we
raised long-term infrastructure bonds as well as refinance borrowings from domestic
financial institutions. Overseas borrowings declined reflecting the reduction in assets.
B. Credit quality
There were net additions of 6.05 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the current quarter
compared to 3.82 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The net additions to gross NPAs
were 5.93 billion Rupees in the retail, rural and business banking portfolios and 0.12 billion
Rupees in the corporate and SME portfolios.
The gross NPA additions were 43.66 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to
58.25 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The gross NPA additions from the retail, rural
and business banking portfolio were 36.58 billion Rupees and from the corporate and SME
portfolio were 7.08 billion Rupees. The gross NPA additions from the corporate and SME
portfolio include the impact of rupee depreciation on existing foreign currency NPAs.
Recoveries and upgrades from gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 37.61
billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 54.43 billion Rupees in the previous
quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 30.65 billion Rupees from the retail, rural
and business banking portfolio and 6.96 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME
portfolio. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 11.03 billion Rupees. The
Bank sold NPAs worth 0.94 billion Rupees on a cash basis in the current quarter compared
to 0.13 billion Rupees in the previous quarter.
Net NPAs declined by 25.3% year-on-year and 8.4% sequentially to 60.99 billion Rupees
at September 30, 2022.
The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 35.16
billion Rupees as of September 30, 2022 compared to 36.70 billion Rupees as of June 30,
2022. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 20.24 billion Rupees as of September 30,
2022 against this non-fund based outstanding.
Page 5 of 22The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers under resolution as per various
guidelines declined to 67.13 billion Rupees or about 0.7% of the total loan portfolio at
September 30, 2022 from 73.76 billion Rupees as of June 30, 2022. Of the total fund based
outstanding under resolution at September 30, 2022, 47.39 billion Rupees was from the
retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 19.74 billion Rupees was from the
corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 20.59 billion Rupees against
these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines.
C. P&L Details
Net interest income increased by 26.5% year-on-year to 147.87 billion Rupees. The net
interest margin was 4.31% in this quarter compared to 4.01% in the previous quarter and
4.00% in Q2 of last year. The net interest margin was 4.16% in H1-2023. There was no
impact of interest on income tax refund on net interest margin in the current quarter. The
domestic NIM was at 4.45% this quarter compared to 4.14% in the previous quarter and
4.09% in Q2 last year. The cost of deposits was 3.55% in this quarter compared to 3.46%
in previous quarter. Of the total domestic loans, interest rates on 44% are linked to the
repo rate, 5% to other external benchmarks and 21% to MCLR and other older
benchmarks. The balance 30% of loans have fixed interest rates. The sequential increase
in NIM reflects the impact of increase in interest rates on loan yields while repricing of
deposits occurs with a lag. While policy rate hikes effected so far should further reflect in
loan yields, we also expect to see the impact of repricing of deposits in future quarters.
Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 16.8% year-on-year to 51.39
billion Rupees in Q2 of 2023
 Fee income increased by 17.6% year-on-year to 44.80 billion Rupees in this quarter.
Fees from retail, rural, business banking and SME customers grew by 19.0% year-
on-year and constituted about 79% of the total fees in this quarter
 Dividend income from subsidiaries and associates was 6.48 billion Rupees in this
quarter compared to 5.83 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year. The year-on-year
increase in dividend income was due to higher final dividend from ICICI General
and final dividend from ICICI Bank UK, offset in part by lower dividend from ICICI
AMC and ICICI Securities

quarter primarily due to retail business and technology related expenses. Our branch

Page 7 of 22D. Growth in digital offerings
Leveraging digital and technology across businesses is a key element of our strategy of
growing the risk-calibrated core operating profit. We continue to see increasing adoption
and usage of our digital platforms from our customers.
There have been about 8 million activations of iMobile Pay by non-ICICI Bank account
holders as of end-September. The value of transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders
in Q2 of this year was 4.4 times the value of transactions in Q2 of last year.
The value of credit card spends in the current quarter grew by 4.4% sequentially and
43.1% year-on-year. We saw a healthy growth in retail credit card spends driven by
increase in discretionary spending, higher activation rate through digital onboarding of
customers, including Amazon Pay credit cards. During the current quarter, we closed
about 817,000 inactive credit cards as per recent RBI guidelines. The Bank has issued more
than 3.5 million Amazon Pay credit cards since its launch.
We have seen about 195,000 registrations from non-ICICI Bank account holders on InstaBIZ
till September 30, 2022. The value of financial transactions on InstaBIZ grew by about
22.8% year-on-year in the current quarter.
We have created more than 20 industry specific STACKs which provide bespoke and
purpose-based digital solutions to corporate clients and their ecosystems. Our Trade
Online and Trade Emerge platforms allow customers to perform most of their trade finance
and foreign exchange transactions digitally. About 70% of trade transactions were done
digitally in Q2 of this year. The value of transactions done through these platforms
increased by 70.1% year-on-year in Q2 of this year.
E. Portfolio information

44 of the investor presentation.
The loan and non-fund based outstanding to performing corporate and SME borrowers
rated BB and below was 76.38 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022 compared to 82.09
billion Rupees at June 30, 2022 and 127.14 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2021. The
amount of 76.38 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022 includes 21.98 billion Rupees of

per RBI’s Covid-19 resolution framework, the maximum single borrower outstanding in
the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022. At

in the outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs is mainly due to disbursements to entities having
long vintage and entities owned by well-established corporate groups.
