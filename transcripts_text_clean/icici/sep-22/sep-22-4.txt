The next question is from the line of Saurabh Kumar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead
Saurabh Kumar:
So, sir, just on this contingent provision, is it fair to assume that you would just target this
2% ROA and effectively that's how the contingent provisions are being made or is there
any reason you made this?
Anindya Banerjee:
No, it's not that way. We are looking at the overall macro environment both globally and
in India in terms of risks to growth, the impact of inflation, interest rates and the geopolitical
risk across our portfolio, wherever we feel that the risk markers are higher and some of
these risks could manifest. On that basis is how we are looking at the contingent
provisions.
