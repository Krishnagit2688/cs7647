The next question is from the line of Manish Ostwal from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.
Manish Ostwal:
On your FY2023 loan book outlook, so, we have not seen the growth rate due to the
inflationary related demand pressure in the economy.
Rakesh Jha:
Like we always say that we don't have any specific loan growth target or outlook. I think
our focus is entirely on growing the risk calibrated core operating profit. So we will grow
in line with the market opportunities which are there, we will look at the risk and the return
parameters to be within our thresholds. In terms of the opportunity, if you look at across
the portfolio, we have seen pretty consistent growth across retail, business banking, SME,
corporate and to the extent we do calibrate our growth where we find that the pricing is
not in line with what we expect. And the entire focus is to not look at just the loan book or
the loan growth, look at the entire operating profit contribution coming from the customer,
coming from the ecosystem. So, that is how we will continue to evaluate these
opportunities on a market basis.

On the loan growth part, just to add, Rakesh, our market shares in individual micro markets
are still not fully saturated. So, we have the option today to pick up more profitable growth,
profitable pools, etc., using data analytics and our reach and understanding of micro
market. We will certainly strive and we are of course, in pockets, also able to pick up those
profit pools and that growth in the market. So we focus on growth, but we try and focus
on profitable growth and more sustainable growth and certainly a risk managed growth.
