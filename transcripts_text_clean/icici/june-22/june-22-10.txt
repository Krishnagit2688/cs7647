The next question is from the line of MB Mahesh from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.
MB Mahesh:
Just 2 questions. Anindya. How does the portfolio behave over the next 2-3 quarters given
the recent increase in the repo rates?
Anindya Banerjee:
So, we have given the numbers, Mahesh. 43% of the book is linked to repo, about 6% is
linked to other external benchmarks and 21% is linked to MCLR. So, our MCLR, we have
increased by 50 basis points at the end of May and June. Repo, as you know, has moved
up by 90 basis points. And these have sort of 3 months to 1 year reset periodicity. So, that
will play out over the next few quarters.

In your assessment that the ability for a full pass-through is visible in the portfolio, adjusted
for the repayments and the cash additions at the spreads, which might be different to what
the portfolio is contracted at?
Anindya Banerjee:
For example, if you look at the repo-linked portfolio, say, the mortgage portfolio. There, as
you know, the floating rate product that is uniform in India has a lengthening of the EMI
schedule up to a certain level, and there is only a smaller set of customers who we would
see an increase in the EMI. So, in the larger corporates, I think they also have their own
fair degree of resilience or ability to kind of refinance and so on. So, it should be
manageable. But as I said, it depends upon the pace and extent of these changes, so we
have to watch as we go along.
MB Mahesh:
Second question, sir. CC/OD changes on the NPL side, I didn't get this in case it was
answered. Was there any impact of it in the current quarter?
Anindya Banerjee:
So, that was a clarification which came in Q4. There would have been some impact, but
nothing that we have quantified for calling out in particular. I think we just have to adjust
to it. There would have been some impact. Hopefully, that impact will trend down.
