Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q1 of FY2023. Joining us today on this call are Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh,
Anindya and Abhinek.
During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in parameters like the index of
industrial production, travel and mobility, pickup in non-oil and non-gold imports and bank
credit. There are concerns arising out of the movements in inflation and interest and
exchange rates, largely reflecting the uncertainties in the global environment. The
Government and the Reserve Bank of India have taken various steps in this regard. We will
continue to monitor these developments closely.
At ICICI Bank, we aim to grow the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
a 360-degree customer-centric approach and by focusing on ecosystems and micro-
markets. We continue to operate within our strategic framework and strengthen our
franchise, enhance our delivery and servicing capabilities and expand our technology and
digital offerings.
Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:
First- Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
the focused pursuit of target market segments
The core operating profit increased by 19.4% year-on-year to 102.73 billion Rupees in this
quarter. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries and associates, core operating profit
grew by 21.1% year-on-year. The profit after tax grew by 49.6% year-on-year to 69.05
billion Rupees in this quarter.
Second-Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Total period-end deposits grew by 13.4% year-on-year at June 30, 2022. During the
quarter, average current account deposits increased by 23.0% year-on-year and 2.9%
sequentially. Average savings account deposits grew by 19.1% year-on-year and 4.4%
Page 2 of 23sequentially. Period-end term deposits grew by 11.4% year-on-year at June 30, 2022. The
liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was about 127%, reflecting continued surplus
liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system.
Third-Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward
The retail loan portfolio grew by 24.4% year-on-year and 5.1% sequentially at June 30,
2022. Including non-fund based outstanding, the retail portfolio was 44.0% of the total
portfolio. The rural portfolio grew by 8.4% year-on-year and was flat sequentially. The
business banking portfolio grew by 44.7% year-on-year and 7.4% sequentially. The SME
portfolio grew by 32.3% year-on-year and declined by 2.6% sequentially. The growth in
SME and business banking portfolios was driven by leveraging our branch network, cross
sell to existing current account customers and digital offerings such as InstaBIZ and
Merchant Stack. The domestic corporate portfolio grew by 14.4% year-on-year and 4.4%
sequentially at June 30, 2022. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 21.7% year-on-year
and 3.9% sequentially. The overall loan portfolio grew by 21.3% year-on-year and 4.3%
sequentially at June 30, 2022.
Fourth-Leveraging digital across our business
We continue to enhance our digital offerings and platforms to onboard new customers in
a seamless manner and provide them end-to-end digital journeys and personalised
solutions. These platforms also enable us to do more data driven cross sell and up sell.
Recently, we have further enhanced the open architecture based features of InstaBIZ.
Merchants can now open a current account instantly and digitally on InstaBIZ by using
video KYC. Through ‘InstaOD Plus’, customers of any bank can avail an overdraft facility
of up to 2.5 million Rupees instantly on InstaBIZ. We have seen about 120,000 registrations
from non-ICICI Bank account holders on InstaBIZ till June 30, 2022. Recently, the Bank
launched a revamped OneSCF, an integrated supply chain platform providing corporate
customers, their vendors and dealers with a one-stop solution to efficiently manage their
working capital requirements. We have shared some details on our technology and digital
offerings in slides 18 to 28 of the investor presentation.
Page 3 of 23Fifth - Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
The net NPA ratio declined to 0.70% at June 30, 2022 from 0.76% at March 31, 2022 and
1.16% at June 30, 2021. During the quarter, there were net additions of 3.82 billion Rupees
to gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale. The provisioning coverage ratio on NPAs
was 79.6% at June 30, 2022. The total provisions during the quarter were 11.44 billion
Rupees or 11.1% of core operating profit and 0.53% of average advances. This includes
contingency provision of 10.50 billion Rupees made on a prudent basis. The Bank holds
contingency provisions of 85.00 billion Rupees or about 0.9% of total loans as of June 30,
2022.
Sixth- Maintaining a strong capital base
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.23%, Tier
1 ratio of 17.95% and total capital adequacy ratio of 18.74% at June 30, 2022, including
profits for the quarter.
Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to grow the core operating profit in a risk-
calibrated manner. In order to leverage these opportunities, we have reorganized our
business teams. Cities with large concentrated market opportunities have been organised
under ‘city business heads’ covering the full spectrum of ecosystems. We have also
focused on strengthening the workforce by skilling and providing cross-functional
opportunities. We will continue to make investments in technology, people, distribution
and building our brand.
Going forward, we will continue to operate within our strategic framework while focusing
on micro markets and ecosystems. The principles of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank” and
“One Bank, One RoE” will guide our operations. We focus on building a culture where
every employee in the Bank serves customers with humility and upholds the values of
brand ICICI. We aim to be the trusted financial services provider of choice for our
customers and deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders.
I now hand the call over to Anindya.
Anindya’s opening remarks
Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details,
growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.
Page 4 of 23A. Balance sheet growth
Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Coming to the growth across
retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 22.3% year-on-year and 4.1% sequentially.

The overseas loan portfolio, in US dollar terms, grew by 7.4% year-on-year and 6.4%
sequentially at June 30, 2022. The increase in the overseas loan portfolio was primarily
due to increase in the India-linked trade finance book. The overseas loan portfolio was
about 5.1% of the overall loan book at June 30, 2022. The non-India linked corporate
portfolio declined by 52.8% or about 513 million US dollars on a year-on-year basis. Of the
overseas corporate portfolio, about 87% comprises Indian corporates, 6% is overseas
corporates with Indian linkage, 4% comprises companies owned by NRIs or PIOs and
balance 3% is non-India corporates.

which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines.
C. P&L Details
Net interest income increased by 20.8% year-on-year to 132.10 billion Rupees. The net
interest margin was 4.01% in this quarter compared to 4.00% in the previous quarter and

fees in this quarter
 Dividend income from subsidiaries and associates was 3.47 billion Rupees in

partly reflecting the low base in Q1 of last year. The employee expenses increased by

D. Growth in digital offerings
Leveraging digital and technology across businesses is a key element of our strategy of
growing the risk-calibrated core operating profit. We continue to see increasing adoption
and usage of our digital platforms from our customers.
There have been 7.3 million activations of iMobile Pay by non-ICICI Bank account holders
as of end-June. The value of transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders increased by
35% sequentially in the current quarter.
The value of credit card spends in the current quarter grew by 12.6% sequentially and was
two times the value of spends in Q1 of last year driven by improvement in discretionary
spending, higher activation rate through digital onboarding of customers, including
Amazon Pay credit cards, and diversification through commercial cards. The Bank has
issued more than 3.2 million Amazon Pay credit cards since its launch.
During the quarter, we launched Campus Power, an online platform providing various
banking solutions such as loans, bank accounts, foreign exchange remittances and value
added services to the student ecosystem for higher education in India and abroad.

current quarter. The value of transactions on the supply chain solutions, CorpConnect and
DigitalLite, in the current quarter was 2.4 times the value of transactions in Q1 last year.

has been increasing steadily. About 33% of our mortgage sanctions and 44% of our
personal loan disbursements, by volume, were end-to-end digital in Q1 of this year.
Page 8 of 23The Bank has created more than 20 industry specific STACKs which provide bespoke and
purpose-based digital solutions to corporate clients and their ecosystems. The volume of
payment and collection transactions through API based solutions in Q1 of this year was

E. Portfolio information
We have provided details on our retail, business banking and SME portfolio in slides 35 to
45 of the investor presentation.
The loan and non-fund based outstanding to performing corporate and SME borrowers
rated BB and below was 82.09 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022 compared to 108.08 billion
Rupees at March 31, 2022. The amount of 82.09 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022 includes
22.89 billion Rupees of loans under resolution. The sequential decline during the quarter
was mainly due to reduction in exposure to a borrower in the telecom sector and upgrades
of a few accounts in power and construction sectors. The details are given on slide 37 and
38 of the investor presentation.
Other than one account in the power sector, where resolution has been implemented as
per RBI’s Covid-19 resolution framework, the maximum single borrower outstanding in
the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022. At June 30,
2022, we held provisions of 8.61 billion Rupees on the BB and below portfolio compared
to 12.32 billion Rupees at March 31, 2022. This includes provisions held against borrowers
under resolution included in this portfolio.
The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 699.72 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022
compared to 686.32 billion Rupees at March 31, 2022. The total outstanding loans to
NBFCs and HFCs were about 8% of our advances at June 30, 2022. The sequential increase
in the outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs is mainly due to disbursements to PSU entities,
entities having long vintage and entities owned by well-established corporate groups.
The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans
and working capital loans was 275.69 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022 compared to 269.48
billion Rupees at March 31, 2022. The builder portfolio is about 3% of our total loan
portfolio. Our portfolio is granular in nature with the larger exposures being to well-
established builders and this is also reflected in the sequential increase in the portfolio.
Page 9 of 23About 8.3% of our builder portfolio at June 30, 2022 was either rated BB and below
internally or was classified as non-performing, compared to about 9.5% at March 31, 2022.
