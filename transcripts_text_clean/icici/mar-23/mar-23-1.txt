Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q4 of FY2023. Joining us today on this call are Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh,
Anindya and Abhinek.
The Indian economy has continued to show resilience amidst a volatile global
environment. The underlying growth momentum is visible in increasing steel and cement
output, GST collections, capacity utilisations, rising demand for electricity and travel. The
Government led capex cycle is continuing. Financial stability has been maintained and
inflation, though elevated, has moderated from its peak. We will continue to monitor
these developments closely.
Our strategic focus is growing our risk calibrated core operating profit through the 360-
degree customer centric approach and by serving opportunities across customer
segments and ecosystems. We continue to operate within our strategic framework and
strengthen our franchise, enhance our delivery and servicing capabilities and expand our
technology and digital offerings.
The core operating profit increased by 36.4% year-on-year to 138.66 billion Rupees in
this quarter and increased by 28.1% year-on-year to 491.39 billion Rupees in FY2023.

sequentially. The SME portfolio grew by 19.2% year-on-year and 6.2% sequentially. The
growth in SME and business banking portfolios was driven by leveraging our branch
network and digital offerings such as InstaBIZ and Merchant Stack. The domestic
Page 2 of 18corporate portfolio grew by 21.2% year-on-year and 3.8% sequentially at March 31, 2023
driven by growth across well-rated financial and non-financial corporates. The rural
portfolio grew by 13.8% year-on-year and 5.5% sequentially. The domestic loan portfolio
grew by 20.5% year-on-year and 5.0% sequentially. The overall loan portfolio grew by

in a seamless manner, provide them end-to-end digital journeys and personalised
solutions and enable a more effective data driven cross sell and up sell. We have shared
some details on our technology and digital offerings in slides 17 to 28 of the investor
presentation.
The net NPA ratio declined to 0.48% at March 31, 2023 from 0.55% at December 31,
2022 and 0.76% at March 31, 2022. During the quarter, there were net additions of 0.14
billion Rupees to gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale. The provisioning coverage
ratio on NPAs was 82.8% at March 31, 2023. The total provisions during the quarter were

This includes contingency provision of 16.00 billion Rupees made on a prudent basis. The
Bank holds contingency provisions of 131.00 billion Rupees or about 1.3% of total loans

Tier 1 ratio of 17.60% and total capital adequacy ratio of 18.34% at March 31, 2023, after
reckoning the impact of proposed dividend.
Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to drive growth in the risk calibrated core
operating profit. We believe our focus on customer 360, extensive franchise and synergy
and collaboration within the organization, backed by our digital offerings and process
improvement and service delivery initiatives will enable us to deliver customized solutions
to customers in a seamless manner and grow market share across key segments. We
will continue to make investments in technology, people, distribution and building our
brand. We will remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with prudent
provisioning and healthy levels of capital. The principles of “Fair to Customer, Fair to
Bank” and “One Bank, One Team, One RoE” will continue to guide our operations. We
remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable returns to our shareholders.
I now hand the call over to Anindya.

the total domestic loans, interest rates on 46% are linked to the repo rate, 3% to other
external benchmarks and 20% to MCLR and other older benchmarks. The balance 31%
of loans have fixed interest rates. The cost of deposits was 3.98% in this quarter
