Next question is from the line of Saurabh from JPMorgan.
Saurabh:
Sir, just two questions. One is, the attrition level at ICICI Bank, would it have gone up
in fiscal '23 versus fiscal '22? Secondly, the growth that we're seeing in personal
loans and credit cards. So have you moderated down risk filters? Or is it due to more
cross-sells through your existing clients, like, if you could give some qualitative color
around that?
Anindya Banerjee:
So, first, I think on attrition we have not yet published our BRSR. That will come out
hopefully in the next 10 to 15 days, and then the numbers would be in the public
domain. I think you've seen the numbers which have come out of some of our peer
set, and they are reasonably high and that's reflective, I guess, of what is happening
across the system over the last 2 years, I would say. So I don't think that there is any
specific thing that we would want to call out really regarding attrition in our context.
On your second question, on credit cards and personal loans, so we have not
moderated any sort of whatever diluted any risk filters on a large-scale basis. Of
course, we would always be trying to sharp shoot and sort of figure out which are
20the pockets where we can do more and which are the pockets that we should do
less. But broadly, I would say, our stance on risk has been quite consistent, and we
keep reviewing the portfolio and the outcome today are well within our tolerance
range.
