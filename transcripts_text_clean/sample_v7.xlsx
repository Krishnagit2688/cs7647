0	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Sandeep Bakhshi  	  Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the results for Q3 of FY2021. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh and Anindya.  Thank you all for joining us today. We hope that you are safe and in good health. India has embarked on what we hope would be the last stage of its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic with the launch of the nationwide vaccination drive. We would like to extend our gratitude to the relentless efforts of the medical and research fraternity, healthcare staff and all essential service providers who have helped to put up a strong fight against Covid-19. I would also like to take a moment here to thank our employees for their service to customers in these challenging times. The Bank’s Economic Research Group’s proprietary Ultra Frequency Index, which comprises several high frequency indicators, reached a record high of 106.3 for the week ending January 17. The index has remained above 100 for the last four weeks indicating that economic activity has crossed pre-COVID levels. Several high frequency indicators such as rural unemployment rates, rail freight revenues, power consumption, e-way bill generation and electronic toll collections were above the pre-Covid levels consistently in the last four weeks. The month of December registered the highest ever monthly collections of GST primarily on the back of festive season sales and rise in collections on imports. The record agricultural output across kharif and rabi seasons last year, steady rise in rabi crop sowing in the current season and increase in tractor sales point towards a strong rural economy. There has also been an uptick in property registrations in December compared to September. These trends are also reflected in the business and results of ICICI Bank, as we continue to steadily grow our business, within our well-defined framework.     ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 3 of 35 1. Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the focused pursuit of target market segments The core operating profit increased by 14.8% year-on-year to 80.54 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021. The profit after tax increased by 19.2% year-on-year to 49.40 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021 from 41.46 billion Rupees in Q3 last year. 2. Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise Deposit growth continued to be strong, with 22.1% year-on-year growth in total deposits at December 31, 2020. During the quarter, average current account deposits increased by 26.5% year-on-year and average savings account deposits by 15.9% year-on-year. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was 146%, reflecting significant surplus liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system. Our 360-degree customer coverage, digital platforms and efforts towards process decongestion have played an important role in the growth of our deposit franchise. 3. Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward The continued pickup in economic activity and tailwinds from the festive season, combined with the Bank’s digital initiatives and extensive franchise reflected in an increase in disbursements across retail products during this quarter. Mortgage disbursements increased further in this quarter over the previous quarter driven by our efforts to offer a convenient and frictionless experience to customers by digitising the entire underwriting process, with instant loan approvals. Disbursements of auto loans have continued to increase from the September levels and have crossed pre-Covid levels in December. Till January 27, 2021, we have disbursed about 120 billion Rupees under the ECLGS 1.0 scheme and about 6 billion Rupees has been disbursed under the ECLGS 2.0 scheme. The overall retail loan portfolio grew by 15.4% year-on-year and 6.8% sequentially. The growth of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was 9.6% year-on-year and 8.5% sequentially. Overall, the domestic loan portfolio grew by 13.3% year-on-year and 7.5% sequentially. The overseas branches portfolio and within that, the non-India linked   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 4 of 35 corporate portfolio, declined both year-on-year and sequentially in line with the approach which we have articulated earlier. 4. Leveraging digital across our business We have continued to reimagine existing digital journeys in order to decongest service delivery and enhance the customer experience. The ICICI STACK helps us to curate and offer hyper-personalised solutions to our customers suiting their life-stage and business needs. During this quarter, we expanded our state-of-the-art mobile banking app, iMobile, to iMobile Pay which offers payment and banking services to customers of any bank. iMobile Pay can be used for making payments using UPI and also offers instant banking services such as opening savings account, investments, loans and credit cards. We have seen about half a million activations of iMobile Pay from non-ICICI Bank customers since it was launched just two months ago. We offer bespoke digital solutions for corporate and institutional customers which enable us to tap into their ecosystems. The steady increase in adoption of these solutions and fund flows through our digital financial supply chain and trade platforms have contributed to the growth of our deposit franchise. We have launched an online platform called ‘Infinite India’ offering not only banking solutions but also other value added services for foreign companies looking to establish or expand business in the country. 5. Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks The indicators around economic activities have been positive and this reflects in the trends of our portfolio. The trends in collections and overdues across loan portfolios continued to improve during the third quarter of the current fiscal year. Rakesh will expand on this later.  Loans amounting to 82.80 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020, compared to 14.10 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020, were not classified as non-performing pursuant to the Supreme Court’s interim order. In addition, the total fund based outstanding to all borrowers under resolution as per RBI’s framework, not included in these proforma NPA numbers, is 25.46 billion Rupees or about 0.4% of the total loan portfolio at December 31,   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 5 of 35 2020. These are in line with or better than our expectations of NPA additions and loans under resolution.  During Q3 of 2021, the Bank made contingency provision amounting to 30.12 billion Rupees for borrower accounts not classified as non-performing pursuant to the Supreme Court’s interim order and utilised 18.00 billion Rupees of Covid-19 related provisions made in earlier periods. Accordingly, the Bank held aggregate Covid-19 related provision of 99.84 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 87.72 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. This includes contingency provision for proforma NPAs amounting to 35.09 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 4.97 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020.  On a proforma basis, the provisioning coverage continued to be robust at 77.6% as of December 31, 2020.  As mentioned in our previous earnings calls, our aim is to be proactive in provisioning with the objective of ensuring that the balance sheet is robust at all times. We have further strengthened our provisioning policies on NPAs during this quarter. Our contingency provisions on proforma non-performing loans during the quarter also takes into account this revised policy. The provisions during the quarter were higher by about 21 billion Rupees due to this more conservative approach.  To summarise on asset quality: The provision coverage ratio on a proforma basis is robust. Less than 90-day overdues above the normal pre-Covid level are substantially lower at end-December compared to end-September. We are confident that the Covid-19 provisions we hold as of end-December will completely cushion the balance sheet from potential credit losses which may arise due to the pandemic. As we have stated earlier, we expect credit costs to normalise in fiscal 2022 based on our current expectations of economic activity and portfolio trends. 6. Maintaining a strong capital base The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 16.79% including the profits for nine months of the current fiscal year. This strong capital position   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 6 of 35 does not include the market value of the Bank’s investments in listed subsidiaries, of about 764 billion Rupees.  Looking ahead, we see optimism in the economy supported by the indicators of resumption of economic activity and continued growth in digitisation. We believe our extensive franchise, high quality digital platforms and solutions, our approach of 360- degree customer centricity, our prudent risk management practices and our strong capital ratios put us in a good position to capture opportunities that will arise in the near and medium term. We will continue to focus on delivering consistent and predictable returns to our shareholders.  With these opening remarks, I will now hand the call over to Rakesh. 	9293		2	 Overall, the domestic loan portfolio grew by 13.

1	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, capital adequacy, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries. A. Balance sheet growth  The overall loan portfolio grew by 10.0% year-on-year at December 31, 2020. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 13.3% year-on-year and 7.5% sequentially at December 31, 2020. The retail portfolio grew by 15.4% year-on-year and 6.8% sequentially. Within the retail portfolio, the mortgage loan portfolio grew by 15.0% year-on-year, business banking by 39.4%, rural lending by 24.6%, commercial vehicle and equipment loans by 8.1% and auto loan portfolio by 6.9%. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 9.1%. This portfolio was 636.56 billion Rupees or 9.1% of the overall loan book at December 31, 2020.  The disbursements in the retail portfolio have increased substantially in Q3 compared to Q2. Sandeep has already talked about the trends in the mortgages and auto loans portfolios. While the disbursements in the commercial vehicle and personal loan portfolios have increased in Q3 compared to Q2, they continue to remain below pre-Covid levels. Credit card spends have reached pre-Covid levels in December led by increased spends   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 7 of 35 in categories such as health & wellness, electronics and e-commerce. These trends resulted in healthy sequential growth across portfolios.  The SME business comprising borrowers with a turnover of less than 2.5 billion Rupees grew by 24.6% year-on-year to 270.93 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020.  The growth of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was 9.6% year-on-year and 8.5% sequentially, driven by disbursements to higher rated corporates to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements. While various sectors and corporate clients contributed to this growth, some focus segments were highly rated PSUs and large established corporate groups.  The overseas loan portfolio declined by 25.7% year-on-year in US dollar terms at December 31, 2020. The overseas loan portfolio was 6.2% of the overall loan book at December 31, 2020. We had mentioned in our previous quarter earnings call that we would be progressively exiting our non-India linked exposures in a planned manner. The non- India linked corporate portfolio reduced by 48.0% year-on-year and 14.1% sequentially at December 31, 2020.  Coming to the funding side: We continue to focus on growing the daily average CASA balances and retail term deposits. Average savings account deposits increased by 15.9% year-on-year and average current account deposits increased by 26.5% year-on-year during the quarter. Total term deposits grew by 26.1% year-on-year to 4.8 trillion Rupees at December 31, 2020.  B. Credit quality  Loans aggregating to 82.80 billion Rupees, compared to 14.10 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020, were not classified as non-performing at December 31, 2020 pursuant to the Supreme Court’s interim order. Of the 82.80 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020, 75.21 billion Rupees was from the retail portfolio and 7.59 billion Rupees was from the corporate and SME portfolio. The reported gross NPA additions during the quarter were 4.71 billion Rupees.    ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 8 of 35 Recoveries and upgrades, excluding write-offs, were 17.76 billion Rupees in the current quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 9.33 billion Rupees from the retail portfolio and 8.43 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 27.36 billion Rupees. The gross NPAs sold during the quarter were 0.88 billion Rupees.  The net non-performing assets were 48.61 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 71.88 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. The gross NPA ratio was 4.38% and the net NPA ratio was 0.63% at December 31, 2020. The gross NPA ratio on a proforma basis was 5.42% at December 31, 2020 compared to 5.36% at September 30, 2020. The proforma net NPA ratio was 1.26% at December 31, 2020 compared to 1.12% at September 30, 2020.  We had mentioned in our previous quarter’s earnings call that the corporate loans under resolution via the framework announced by RBI in August would be less than 1% of the total loan portfolio of the Bank.  Excluding proforma NPAs, the total fund based outstanding to all borrowers under resolution is about 25.46 billion Rupees or about 0.4% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Of the above fund based outstanding, 8.37 billion Rupees was from the retail loan portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 3.85 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is in excess of the requirement as per RBI guidelines. Going forward, the asset classification of corporate and SME borrowers under resolution would depend on the timing of implementation of resolution schemes and payment performance in the interim. As you are aware that there is time till June 30, 2021 to implement the resolution. Resolution has also been invoked for proforma NPA loans amounting to 8.88 billion Rupees.  Compared to the normal pre-Covid trend, the percentage of the retail EMI products and credit card portfolio which was overdue for less than 90 days was about 1.5% higher at December 31, 2020 compared to about 4% higher at September 30, 2020. The percentage of the performing rural portfolio which was overdue at December 31, 2020 was about 1.5% higher than the normal pre-Covid trend compared to about 1% higher at September 30, 2020. The percentage of the SME and business banking portfolio overdue for less than 90 days was similar to the pre-Covid levels at September-end and remains so at December- end. In the domestic and overseas corporate loan portfolio, less than 2% of the portfolio   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 9 of 35 was overdue for less than 90 days at December 31, 2020 compared to less than 3% at September 30, 2020.  C. P&L Details  Net interest income increased by 16.0% year-on-year to 99.12 billion Rupees. Interest on income tax refund was 1.96 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 0.26 billion Rupees in the previous quarter and 0.16 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. We have reversed the interest accrued on proforma NPAs and the same is reflected in the net interest income for the current and previous quarter. The net interest margin was at 3.67% in Q3 of 2021 compared to 3.57% in the previous quarter and 3.77% in Q3 of last year. The impact of interest on income tax refund and interest collections from NPAs was about 11 basis points this quarter compared to about 3 basis points in the previous quarter and about 10 basis points in Q3 of last year. The domestic NIM was at 3.78% this quarter compared to 3.72% in Q2 and 4.04% in Q3 last year. International margins were at 0.34%. The cost of deposits was 3.97% in Q3 compared to 4.22% in Q2.  Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, declined by 3.0% year-on-year to 39.21 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021.   Fee income was 36.01 billion Rupees in Q3. Compared to a decline of 30.8% year-on- year in Q1 of 2021 and 9.7% year-on-year in Q2 of 2021, fee income grew by 0.1% year- on-year in Q3 of 2021. The sequential growth in fee income was 14.7% reflecting the continuing normalisation in customer spending and borrowing activity  Dividend income from subsidiaries was 3.56 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021 compared to 3.67 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year  On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 3.7% year-on-year in Q3. The operating expenses increased by 12.6% sequentially. The employee expenses increased marginally by 0.4% year-on-year. The Bank had 92,103 employees at December 31, 2020. We expect the employee count to increase during Q4 of 2021. Non-employee expenses increased by 5.5% year-on-year in Q3 of 2021 due to increase in retail business related costs and technology related expenses partly offset by decrease in advertisement and sales promotion expenses. We would expect business related expenses to increase in   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 10 of 35 future quarters as business volumes increase further from the current levels. We continue to make investments in technology and to grow our franchise.  The core operating profit increased by 14.8% year-on-year to 80.54 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021. The core operating profit grew by 15.9% during 9M of 2021.  The treasury income was 7.66 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 5.42 billion Rupees in Q2. The treasury income this quarter includes 3.29 billion Rupees from sale of 2.2% stake in ICICI Securities compared to 3.05 billion Rupees in Q2. These stake sales were undertaken to meet the minimum public shareholding requirement by March 2021, as required by applicable regulation.  During Q3 of 2021, the Bank made contingency provision amounting to 30.12 billion Rupees for proforma NPAs. We utilised 18.00 billion Rupees of Covid-19 related provisions made in the earlier periods. Accordingly, the Bank held aggregate Covid-19 related provision of 99.84 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 87.72 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. This includes contingency provision for proforma NPAs amounting to 35.09 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 4.97 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. On a proforma basis, the provisioning coverage continued to be robust at 77.6% as of December 31, 2020.  At December 31, 2020, the total outstanding Covid-19 related provisions, provisions for non-fund based outstanding to NPAs, general provisions on standard assets and other standard asset provisions were 164.01 billion Rupees or 2.3% of loans. This includes contingency provisions of 35.09 billion Rupees on proforma NPAs.  As Sandeep mentioned, we are confident that these provisions will completely cushion the balance sheet from the potential credit losses which may arise due to the pandemic.  The profit before tax increased by 11.2% to 60.78 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2021 compared to 54.65 billion Rupees in Q3 last year. The tax expense was 11.38 billion in Q3 of 2021 compared to 13.19 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The tax expense declined due to lower effective tax rate in Q3 of 2021 mainly because of higher gains from sale of stake in subsidiaries in fiscal 2021 which are not subject to tax. The profit after tax   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 11 of 35 grew by 19.2% to 49.40 billion Rupees in Q3 this year compared to 41.46 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year.  The consolidated profit after tax was 54.98 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 48.82 billion Rupees in Q2 and 46.70 billion Rupees in Q3 last year. The consolidated RoE was 14.6% this quarter.  D. Capital  The CET1 ratio, including profits for 9M of 2021, was 16.79% at December 31, 2020 compared to 16.54% at September 30, 2020. Including profits for 9M of 2021, the Tier 1 ratio was 18.12% and the total capital adequacy ratio was 19.51% at December 31, 2020.  E. Portfolio information  We are focused on growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward. Our retail is built based on proprietary data and analytics in addition to bureau checks, and well-priced in relation to the risk. Our strong deposit franchise enables us to offer competitive pricing to the selected customer segments. We have given further information on our portfolio in slides 31 to 34 of our investor presentation.  The loans and non-fund based outstanding to corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and below (excluding proforma NPAs) was 180.61 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 161.67 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020, details of which are given on slide 35 of the investor presentation.  Other than four accounts, two in construction and one each in the telecom and power sectors, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was about 6 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020.  On slide 36 of the presentation, we have provided the movement in our BB and below portfolio during Q3 of 2021. In Q3 of 2021:    ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 12 of 35  The rating downgrades from investment grade categories were 22.39 billion Rupees. The downgrades were largely from the construction sector;  There was a net decrease in outstanding of 1.45 billion Rupees;  There was a reduction of 1.50 billion Rupees due to inclusion of some borrowers in the proforma NPAs and devolvement of 0.77 billion Rupees of non-fund based outstanding to NPAs; and  There were upgrades of 0.27 billion Rupees from NPA to below investment grade categories  Except one lease rental discounting account, all corporate and SME borrowers under resolution as per RBI’s framework were rated below investment grade at December 31, 2020.  The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans and working capital loans was 225.57 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 or 3.2% of our total loan portfolio. As mentioned in our previous calls, our portfolio is granular in nature with the larger exposures being to well-established builders. About 13% of our builder portfolio at December 31, 2020 was either rated BB and below internally or was classified as non-performing.  The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 576.29 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020 compared to 501.31 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. The total outstanding loans to NBFCs and HFCs were about 6% of our advances at December 31, 2020. The details are given on slide 38 of the investor presentation. Our exposure is largely to well-rated entities with PSUs, long vintage, entities owned by banks and well-established corporate groups. The sequential increase in the outstanding to NBFC and HFCs during the quarter reflects this. The proportion of the NBFC and HFC portfolio internally rated BB and below or non- performing is about 1%.  Coming to our overseas portfolio, excluding exposures to financial institutions and retail lending against deposits, the total corporate fund and non-fund outstanding of overseas branches, net of cash or bank or insurance backed lending, was 5.20 billion US dollars at December 31, 2020 compared to 5.47 billion US dollars at September 30, 2020 and 8.62 billion US dollars at December 31, 2019. 69% of the outstanding at December 31, 2020   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 13 of 35 was to Indian corporates and their subsidiaries and joint ventures. 16% of the outstanding was to non-India companies with Indian or India-linked operations and activities. The portfolio in this segment is well-rated and the Indian operations of these companies are target customers for the Bank’s deposit and transaction banking franchise, and we would continue to pursue risk-calibrated opportunities in this segment. 6% of the outstanding was to companies owned by NRIs or PIOs. 9% of the outstanding was to other non-India companies which is less than 1% of the total portfolio of the Bank.  F. Subsidiaries The details of the financial performance of subsidiaries is covered in slides 43-44 and 63- 68 in the investor presentation.  Value of new business of ICICI Life was 10.30 billion Rupees in 9M of 2021 The new business margin increased from 21.7% in fiscal 2020 to 26.0% in 9M of 2021. The new business margin was 25.7% this quarter.

So, the increase of Rs. 68.70 billion and Rs. 4.71 billion, i.e about Rs. 73 billion is what we have seen during the quarter.

5	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 So, Mahrukh, normally on the retail side we give the aggregate additions and deletions on the portfolio. To give a sense, I think we have seen slippages across portfolios. If you are comparing it to an earlier period, of course, it is higher across products. I think during this quarter we have seen the entire portfolio getting tested for payment because it has come out of moratorium. So, the increase that we have seen on the NPA or the proforma NPA is largely in line with what we were expecting across portfolios or slightly better in some of the portfolios. So, that is the colour that we can give on this. Going forward, we expect to see some bit of lower addition, I am taking proforma as the comparable number, as the moratorium period has got over, and the full impact has been seen in the December quarter.	818		0	So, Mahrukh, normally on the retail side we give the aggregate additions and deletions on the portfolio.

7	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 Mahrukh, we don't want to really comment on how that number will pan out, but it should be lower than where we are in the December quarter in terms of additions. I think that's the reason we also gave a colour on the portfolio which is overdue. We had talked about that in September also. We have seen there that the trends have improved on the retail EMI products and cards portfolio, now we are about 1.5% higher than the pre-COVID normal trend compared to 4% which was the case in September. So, overall, the overdue portfolio also has come down. So, yes, we should see improvement going forward. How substantial it is, we will have to see how it plays out, there are a lot of moving parts there. But again to reiterate what we said, Mahrukh, I think we have taken provisions upfront in March and June quarter. We have utilized some of that provision this quarter, about Rs. 18 billion. We have tightened some of our provisioning policies to take more provision on NPAs. So, overall we are quite comfortable with the trends that we are seeing on the portfolio, and especially the one variable which was there in October was around the restructuring or the resolution pipeline. As you see that number is pretty much similar to actually the pipeline we had in October and we have not seen much of an increase there. So, these are the trends which give us some comfort that going forward the numbers should decline. But   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 16 of 35 again, the numbers will be high for March quarter, and that will be the case because the overdues are currently higher than the normal pre-COVID level.	1622		0	 So, overall we are quite comfortable with the trends that we are seeing on the portfolio, and especially the one variable which was there in October was around the restructuring or the resolution pipeline.

If you look at the corporate and SME portfolio of Rs. 180 billion rated BB and below, it includes all the corporate and SME restructuring, other than one account which I mentioned. It's not a large account. It's an LRD account. It continues to be rated in the investment grade category. The downgrades that we saw of Rs. 22 billion during the quarter would also have come largely from the restructuring proposals that we have received and we have invoked. There would be a couple of other smaller size accounts also which have got downgraded. That's why that number is Rs. 22 billion for the quarter.	637		1	If you look at the corporate and SME portfolio of Rs.  180 billion rated BB and below, it includes all the corporate and SME restructuring, other than one account which I mentioned.	progress behind contribute said statement not clear invest correct unclear positive history	buying acquisitions debt there stable fall clear negative show unchanged fail downgrade good consolidate said different data correct yes adjustments intact progress investments ratings bearish contribute numbers not unclear positive one

So, we don't want to double count there. Of the Rs. 25 billion which are less than 90 days overdue, Rs. 8 billion is retail and about Rs. 17 billion fund based is corporate. Mahrukh Adajania: Got it.

So, essentially increasing the provisioning on the early buckets   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 17 of 35 and also prepone a bit when we reach the 100% provision level. That's the reason you would see that on the proforma NPAs for the quarter of Rs. 82 billion, we have already made provisions of Rs. 30 billion. Of the Rs. 35 billion of provision between the Rs. 5 billion we did in September and Rs. 30 billion we did in this quarter, we are pretty much at 40% in the first quarter itself. We have kind of increased the early bucket provisioning for the NPAs. This is not a one-time change in policy, this is something that we will continue with in future as well.	785		2	 So, essentially increasing the provisioning on the early buckets   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 17 of 35 and also prepone a bit when we reach the 100% provision level.

It will definitely be different for, say, a mortgage or a car loan or an unsecured retail or corporate portfolio. I was saying that, because this quarter will have an impact on the stock. The entire book impact will be there in this quarter. So, we have increased the provision that we take in the early buckets on the NPAs. Moderator: Thank you.

15	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Jai Mundra 	  Thanks for the detailed disclosure. If I were to look at the proforma GNPA number of Rs. 82 billion, this is just the net number, right?

16	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 No, that's not right. So, the table that we have on Slide 26, if you have it in front of you, we have given the movement in NPA based on the reported NPA as per the current guidelines of RBI and not classifying accounts which are more than 90 days overdue as NPA. So, the total reported gross addition is Rs. 4.71 billion. That is the gross addition which has nothing   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 18 of 35 to do with recoveries and write-offs. So, in addition to that Rs. 4.71 billion, we also had Rs. 82.80 billion of loans which were overdue for more than Rs. 90 days on December 31, 2020 and we did not classify them as NPAs because of the Supreme Court ruling. The corresponding number to the Rs. 82.80 billion number at September 30, 2020 was Rs. 14.10 billion. So there was a Rs. 68.70 billion increase in the 90-day overdue, which we were not able to classify during the quarter. So, the Rs. 68.70 billion plus the Rs. 4.71 billion, that’s Rs. 73 billion, would reflect as the gross addition that you are looking at. Then you would have had the recoveries of Rs. 17.76 billion and write-offs and all of that. So, that is how one has to look at it. And this Rs. 82.80 billion, again just to clarify, this is loans which are at a borrower level outstanding for more than 90 days. So, if a borrower has two or three accounts, even if only one account is more than 90 days overdue, all the accounts are categorized as proforma NPA in this number.	1462		1	70 billion increase in the 90-day overdue, which we were not able to classify during the quarter.  73 billion, would reflect as the gross addition that you are looking at.

So, the table that we have on Slide 26, if you have it in front of you, we have given the movement in NPA based on the reported NPA as per the current guidelines of RBI and not classifying accounts which are more than 90 days overdue as NPA.  So, if a borrower has two or three accounts, even if only one account is more than 90 days overdue, all the accounts are categorized as proforma NPA in this number.  So, the total reported gross addition is Rs.	estimates complete increase neutral missing there add statements changed clear negative invest show confidential nothing money reported statement figures calculations accounts benefit said data unknown zero right correct rise yes progress contribute bearish nil below not assumptions unclear positive	estimates behind complete increase answered missing happened there fall statements changed done negative clear invest broken show confidential loans dated money reported statement borrow falling figures calculations accounts good said comments data zero payments right correct yes adjustments intact change progress contribute bearish not unclear positive [UNK] history closed over

I think in the last six months this was further tested and probably only a small portion has asked for restructuring. So, how should one look at the riskiness of this book going forward? Or would it be too early to sort of comment there?	342		1	 So, how should one look at the riskiness of this book going forward. And second question is on BB and below book.	progress behind comments fall changed correct unclear yes history over	fall mistake remarks resigned fail follow saying concerns said comments right correct yes progress comment not unclear history over
19	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 As I have said earlier, it is below investment grade for us. So, by definition, this is relatively higher risk and ideally we would want it to be zero, but in banking business that can never be zero. So, I think the level at which it is right now, it's not a number that we over-worry about. If you look at the Rs. 180 billion, out of that, Rs. 44 billion is non-fund based outstanding to NPAs. So it's not really BB and below, it's non-fund based outstanding to NPAs, on which we already hold provision of about Rs. 14 billion and we disclose that   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 19 of 35 number on a quarter-on-quarter basis. If you remove that, the rest of it is Rs. 135 billion. A lot of it is granular, Rs. 40 billion is to borrowers with outstanding less than Rs. 1 billion. So, as a part of the overall portfolio, you will always have some amount of BB and below. And we call out the larger exposures. We have four accounts which are larger than Rs. 6 billion within this BB and below, out of which one is an account in construction sector that has sought a restructuring. It got included in this quarter in the BB and below. There is one non-fund based outstanding for a construction company which is already classified as NPA and then there is one each in telecom and power where we have been getting the payments. The telecom one is non-fund based and the power one is where we have been getting payment but with some delays. It belongs to a large promoter group as well. So, overall, of course, it's a risky book. I don't want to say we are comfortable, but that is the colour of the book which we can give.	1628		1	 So, by definition, this is relatively higher risk and ideally we would want it to be zero, but in banking business that can never be zero.  So it's not really BB and below, it's non-fund based outstanding to NPAs, on which we already hold provision of about Rs.  So, as a part of the overall portfolio, you will always have some amount of BB and below. As I have said earlier, it is below investment grade for us.  I don't want to say we are comfortable, but that is the colour of the book which we can give.  It belongs to a large promoter group as well.  We have four accounts which are larger than Rs.

21	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 So, if you look at the position at December 31, 2020, you are right that Rs. 180 billion already includes the corporate and SME restructuring request that has come, other than one account, which is a lease rental discounting account, which is still investment grade. The downgrades that we have seen during the quarter of Rs. 22 billion, that would include a few cases which were investment grade and would have sought restructuring. But at the end of December, the BB and below includes all the restructuring, barring one case. Moderator: Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Nitin Agarwal from Motilal Oswal.

22	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Nitin Agarwal 	  My question is again on the BB and below book. Now, we have not seen as much of slippages or restructuring requests as to how much one can really expect this book to throw up, because despite all the focus on this book, it's still around Rs. 180 billion. It has been like pretty sticky and increasing very marginally. So, are we being too conservative there in terms of our classification? Because our peers have actually reported a decline in the actual size of the book.	474		0	 Now, we have not seen as much of slippages or restructuring requests as to how much one can really expect this book to throw up, because despite all the focus on this book, it's still around Rs.

23	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 So, I think we have a pretty standard process which our risk team runs for the rating of the portfolio. Of course, the risk team is completely independent of business, the business team may have a different view on some of these accounts. But it's a very consistent process. So, I don't think we have become overly conservative on these ratings. I gave you an example of the larger accounts. There are some challenges or the other in each of these accounts and we review the portfolio regularly. So, even as we speak between December 31 and now, there would have been some accounts which would have got upgraded during this period and some may have gotten downgraded. So, it's a continuous process which is there and at the end of the day, there will always be a certain amount of book which will be there in the BB and below bucket. I think largely it is not lumpy, other than the accounts I talked about. So, it is not something which we overly worry about.	960		1	 Of course, the risk team is completely independent of business, the business team may have a different view on some of these accounts.

24	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Nitin Agarwal 	  Okay. And two clarifications, one is on the margin, like we have reported a 10 basis point sequential improvement, but both our domestic and overseas margins have expanded by 6 basis points and 8 basis points. So, what am I missing here?  What is driving this blended 10 basis points improvement? And secondly, our tax rate for the year so far is around 19%, moving between 18% and 19% every quarter. So, where do we expect this from a year end for FY 2022?	459		2	 So, where do we expect this from a year end for FY 2022.

25	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 So, on the tax rate, this year, as I said, I think we have got the benefit of the lower tax which is applicable on the capital gains, and we had a good amount of capital gains in the nine- month period, especially in Q1, from the sale of share in the subsidiaries. As you know, the   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 21 of 35 tax which we provide every quarter, or the nine-month period is based on the full year estimated tax rate. So, the tax rate for this nine-month period is what you can extrapolate as our estimate for the tax rate for the full year. Going forward, next year, I think, we will be at marginal tax rate. We get some amount of benefit of 1-1.5% because of dividend income and all of that. So, the tax rate will go up next year. It will be very difficult to give the exact amount by which it will go up because it will still be a function of the composition of the income. On the net interest margin, Nitin, don't do this domestic and overseas and try to tally that. As you would appreciate, we have lending from domestic into overseas also, so it will not always net off. The domestic and overseas margins here are the gross ones. When we report at the Bank level, if there is some lending from domestic to overseas, that would get netted off. So, that's why a few basis points up and down will always be there. The overseas net interest margin is on the gross book. There is the inter-branch elimination that will happen. That's the only reason. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Parmeshwaran S from Jeffries. Please go ahead. Prakhar:  Hi, this is Prakhar. And congratulations to all of you for being able to manage in such tough times. Just a couple of things on the retail side, Rakesh. You did indicate the split of slippages across retail and corporate on a proforma basis. Just to get a hunch, would it be fair to assess like your peer group in this quarter, the unsecured slippages would have been elevated much more. So, peers have seen something like 4% to 5% of the unsecured book slip into NPL, hopefully it normalizes. So, would it be fair to assume that the numbers would be somewhere in that handle or probably even lower because we have been fairly conservative on the lending side?	2251		2	 When we report at the Bank level, if there is some lending from domestic to overseas, that would get netted off.

26	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	 So, Prakhar, actually in a response to an earlier query in terms of how the numbers are, I think we have seen slippages across the portfolio, like, on the secured side also we have seen slippages to be there. For example, on mortgages, the instalment amounts are large, so at times customers are not able to make those payments. I think we have to just see   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 22 of 35 over the next few months how it kind of eventually plays out. But we have seen it's not that unsecured is a very disproportionate contribution to the gross NPA additions. We have seen additions on the secured side also. And again, like I said, when we had done our analysis, we were assuming that on the secured side also we would see slippages. For example, in car loans, the proportion of salaried customers are generally lower, so we would have had some slippages coming from that portfolio. Mortgages, I said, the EMI levels are higher, so people take some more time to kind of become current as well. It is spread across portfolio and it is in line with our expectation. In some of the portfolios, like rural, business banking, SME, corporate, it is better than what we would have estimated. Prakhar:  Sure. So, just a connected question on this one. Now that the portfolio has broadly behaved well and within your expectations, it's great to see that last quarter you didn't make any provisions, from now on you have the comfort to start digging into it. So, would it be fair to also assume that, from a strategy perspective you don't need to really make any material changes in terms of new client acquisitions and the level of leverage you have, etc., on the retail loans? Would that be a fair assessment?	1721		0	 Now that the portfolio has broadly behaved well and within your expectations, it's great to see that last quarter you didn't make any provisions, from now on you have the comfort to start digging into it.

So, there we are pretty comfortable. Of course, we have tightened some of the parameters based on the current environment. The entire focus is to ensure that we get a set of customers who we are comfortable with in terms of return of capital and that's the philosophy across all portfolios. Prakhar: And just one last question. The credit card part, nice improvement and probably supported by the festive lending or usage. Has the level of revolvers come down in this period or are they different in some other way because there is a lot of pay later stuff that is happening in the market. So, would the proportion of revolver be stable as it used to be? Or would it have moved a little more than usual?

38	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 On the corporate portfolio, the growth that we are seeing is largely from the new business that we have done during the quarter and is predominantly from clients rated A-minus and above internally. It is a mix of short-term and long-term lending that we have done during the quarter and about half of it would have been short-term in nature, meaning less than one-year maturity, balance would have been longer term loans. These longer term loans are all floating rate loans. On pricing, when the credit is good, pricing is always competitive. For us, the cost of deposits is also pretty low, you have seen during the quarter also the cost of deposits has come down. So, this lending is not looked at as a standalone lending. In almost all the cases it is looked at from a client profitability point of view. So, what we track for each of the clients is the client level return on equity and that is something where we are happy with the numbers that we have. Of course, there is a lot more that we can do to improve. We have seen good amount of growth on the transaction banking side, FX and the current account deposits during the quarter and year on year. A lot of that has come from the corporate clients. So, on an overall basis, Saurabh, we are comfortable with the returns which are there. But, yes, the markets are very competitive. So, we get to look at all the deals where we believe it would make sense for the bank, from a return perspective. Sometimes from a liquidity deployment perspective, we go ahead with those transactions. So, that is how we have looked at it. On the SME, business banking, I think, if you look at the last couple of years, we have been growing quite well. I think the moratorium tested the portfolio and it has come out pretty well. These are portfolios where our market shares are generally lower than what we have on an average. There is a lot more that we can do. There is a lot of synergy outcome that we have seen as we do more and more of this business through our branches. We have talked about all the digital initiatives that we have taken during our Analyst Day. We have made the process, the underwriting and all of that, much more decongested. So, I think all of that is contributing to this growth. Again, if we go back to last year, this was the growth trend which was there for these portfolios.   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 26 of 35 On the overseas margins, Saurabh, difficult to say. I think, you should just assume it would be around the level where it is now. Because we will not be doing corporate lending there and actually doing a lot of trade finance, loan against FD or those kinds of businesses where the margins will be lower and the capital deployed will be lower. Overall, the book has now come down to about 6.0%- 6.5% of total loans. So, it's difficult to give further guidance on the margin per se. That's not a specific focus area for us to be able to project that. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manish Shukla from Citigroup. Please go ahead.	3054		2	 So, I think all of that is contributing to this growth.  Of course, there is a lot more that we can do to improve.

42	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 Here again, the Bank is not very focused on a particular number of growth, per se. I think the opportunity is there. As we have seen, at least in the last few months, the economy has been recovering, there has been demand. If the demand sustains and from our point of view the pricing is appropriate, the customer profitability is appropriate, we believe we are   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 27 of 35 very well-positioned to grow. We have talked about all that we have done on the process of underwriting, on the digital enablement, especially in the mortgages. So, from a growth point of view, we would be happy to grow as long as it meets our return criteria. On the risk part of it, we are very clear in terms of what we want to underwrite and what we don't want to underwrite. We have also started looking at customers on a 360-degree basis. So, as we drive some of these business through our ecosystems. For example, we have seen a very good amount of growth coming in from the corporate ecosystem, the corporate salary accounts that we have, we have had a lot more focus on the liabilities there, we are also doing a lot more on lending there. All of this, we believe, are things that we can do without taking any undue risk or diluting our returns. Of course, in the near-term liquidity surplus is there, you can see in our balance sheet also we are sitting with significant surplus liquidity. LCR is 140%-150%. So, some of it on pricing and all will always be a tactical call also in the near-term. But from a growth point of view, that is how we look at it. There is no specific number that we are chasing on retail or on corporate side.	1658		2	 We have talked about all that we have done on the process of underwriting, on the digital enablement, especially in the mortgages.  For example, we have seen a very good amount of growth coming in from the corporate ecosystem, the corporate salary accounts that we have, we have had a lot more focus on the liabilities there, we are also doing a lot more on lending there.  So, some of it on pricing and all will always be a tactical call also in the near-term.  There is no specific number that we are chasing on retail or on corporate side. Here again, the Bank is not very focused on a particular number of growth, per se.  We have also started looking at customers on a 360-degree basis.	acquisitions complete increase there concerned statements clear invest grow here remarks limited money expanded spend talked grown good changing spoke said comments started private correct working yes bullish progress contribute growing bearish numbers comment not unclear positive over	acquisitions decline attractive increase reasonable there fall grow clear invest here doing limited money statement expanded figures return mixed grown opportunities good appropriate said comments different value right yes progress investments growing struggled contribute comment not unclear positive over

They are quite low in some, I mean, they are below 5% actually for these businesses. Because of ecosystems, 360-degree banking, there is a lot more colour we have on underwriting. We have enabled and empowered our branches quite a bit. So, I agree with Rakesh that there is a headroom for us to grow in these markets. In fact, across most products we have headroom to grow. Because if you look at our market share, compared to the potential that we have, I must say that we have not done justice to the potential that we have. We should do more justice to the potential that is there in the market.	680		1	 In fact, across most products we have headroom to grow.

So the provision of Rs. 4.97 billion on proforma NPAs at September 30, 2020 has become Rs. 35.09 billion and we utilized Rs. 18.00 billion from the other COVID provisions.

51	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 We have given you the movement, Mahesh, that will just tell you the numbers actually. So, if you look at it, we have given the break of reported gross NPA additions of Rs. 4.71 billion in terms of retail and corporate. We have also given the breakup of Rs. 82.80 billion in terms of retail and corporate. So, of the Rs. 4.71 billion, Rs. 3.94 billion rupees is retail. Of the Rs. 82.80 billion, about Rs. 75.00 billion rupees is retail. So, indeed, most of the slippage during the quarter, as expected, has come from the retail side. So, right. Mahesh:  Perfect. And last question to Anup. On the housing portfolio specifically, this massive shift that you are seeing today, is it because of, refinancing which is happening or is it new loans?

52	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  So, first, let me take the portfolio yield correction. I think broadly, yield correction has happened, because everybody has put out so much of advertisements that even if you were putting shades and glares you will see it. I don't think there is anybody who has not seen that the rates have come down. I think everybody has seen. Certainly there is some element of balance transfer, but not much, because everybody is matching the rates. So, if you are giving it to new customers, why will you not hold on to your portfolio by correcting it. So, that is the second thing that by and large people hold on to their portfolio. Certainly, there is a demand in the market. We are also seeing a shift in shares because of our processes, better distribution and better analytics of our own customers who have taken loans from others and engagement levels are much better. So, I would say that partly demand, a little bit of balance transfer, certainly not a majority or anything like that and a large part because of our distribution process. Because we are seeing that the gap is decreasing, otherwise it would have been a parallel stuff with everybody else. So, shares are increasing. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Adarsh Parasrampuria from CLSA.

54	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 Adarsh, during the quarter, we have seen the yield on advances has come down by about 44 basis points. It is there on Slide 49. But the yield on overall interest earning assets has not come down as much because the yield on investments has not come down as much. Further, advances have grown. As the liquidity is getting deployed, the rest of the portfolio has not grown. So, going forward, I think we should hopefully see improvement in margin. But again, there are so many variables which are there, one of course is the interest reversal itself. In March quarter we will still see new NPL additions that would clearly be higher than   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 31 of 35 any kind of a normal level. So, there will be some amount of interest reversal which will be there. But I think more and more the liquidity will also start declining for us. The LCR numbers that you see should come down in the March quarter. That should help the margin. I talked that on the lending side, the market is extremely competitive. So there the pricing pressure is definitely there on the new loans that we are giving. In short, Adarsh, we are not giving any guidance there. But I think the objective is to improve our margin and we hopefully should be able to do that.	1267		0	 But I think more and more the liquidity will also start declining for us.

58	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 Yes. That is possible. I think one thing which is there, Adarsh, right now is that across all banks things are a bit difficult to compare because of this pro forma basis which is happening and moratorium and all of that. So, I think in terms of the interest treatment itself during the period of moratorium, in some cases you have accrued that as income, in some cases you have put that as a deferred interest term loan. So, the reversal when it happens, happens only for a 90-day period. So, I would say that it is not something which will result in a very sharp increase going forward. Of course, there will be a positive going forward because this quarter was slightly higher than normal.

It is Rs. 120 billion disbursements and let's say, Rs. 60-70 billion of ECLGS book. This portfolio, I think, it is fair to say that we don't really know the debt servicing, what's happening there. So, how do you look at the risk in this portfolio on the lending that we were having outstanding at February or March 2020?

60	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 That is a possibility. We believe, where we have extended credit under this scheme, it is not that these are bad loans where we have kind of extended this scheme. So, it is not something that we are overly worried about, about this portfolio where we have lent. Will there be some challenges that could come up? Definitely, because these borrowers would have got impacted by COVID, generally speaking. So, I think in the outlook that we give, for example, Adarsh, for next year, say, credit cost getting normalised, this is factored in and we don't believe there is going to really be any material impact for us going forward, which is getting postponed due to this.	667		1	 So, I think in the outlook that we give, for example, Adarsh, for next year, say, credit cost getting normalised, this is factored in and we don't believe there is going to really be any material impact for us going forward, which is getting postponed due to this.

61	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Also, actually, we have to see the disbursement to sanction ratio and you will see that for stronger banks the disbursement to sanction ratio is lower. So, that is one marker. The second marker we always see is that, in general, on the portfolio how is the limit utilisation. If economic activity has not picked up, but limit utilisation is happening very fast, that is also not a very good sign. So, these are the two big markers. When we look at these two markers, it looks okay at this point of time for us. I mean, there are no such red flags in that portfolio. These are the two markers that we will have to see. Also, now we are seeing one by one sectors are coming back. As Sandeep had said that, if you look at our ultra-high frequency index, it has been above 100 for a few weeks now which also means that if you are not there in those sectors which have not come up, rest is all business as usual. It is also showing up in the fact that 1-90 days or 0-90 days above your business as usual has also declined sharply. Which basically means that people are now getting cash flows and they are paying up.   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 33 of 35 So, all in all, I would say that things are okay. Now, the other thing that one can always surmise is that, how much of it is by way of refinancing, how much of this is by way of balance transfer and how much of it is by way of pent-up demand. All those are very difficult to say. Of course, whenever interest rates suddenly fall, there is some activity on balance transfer and refinancing, that is for sure it happens. But interest rate from here on, we do not think it is going to fall that much. So, the balance transfer activity will come down. So, shift of portfolio from one bank to the other will come down. We don't think that there will be much of a pent-up demand for long, because now the economy has been open for four-five months. Last quarter also we had good disbursements and good book growth. This quarter also we had good disbursement and good book growth. We look at market shares, as I said, at a micro market level. It is okay, I mean, still quite a bit of unsaturation is there for our customers and their needs. So, that is what it is. We have spoken to the ECLGS customers. We have called all of them and we have spoken to them as well. They seem to be okay. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from Abhishek Murarka from IIFL Securities.

64	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  But in general, Abhishek, just to give you some sense on the payment landscape that is happening. Very clearly UPI is coming up. It will first cannibalise debit card and credit card   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 34 of 35 is a separate animal because you get credit free period. So, that is coming up. Credit card in its physical format is getting replaced by card not present transactions as e-commerce is going up. So, payment system landscape is moving. The good thing for banks like us is that, while everybody talks about other PSPs, the fact is that all those transactions also go through the bank at the backend. So, if someone says that we have got Rs. 100 million transactions happening through us, we should also, by corollary, understand that Rs. 100 million is also going through the banks. So, it is now up to us to input that data also in our underwriting and in profiling and make sure that we are able to utilise it better. I would also go on to the extent to say that many of them may not have fully utilised use cases. Banking system has use cases, because you can lend to them and you can cross-sell to them with that data. So, I would say that the data quality and the throughput of the data is certainly helping in understanding the client in a much deeper way. That also certainly is one of the drivers of our higher disbursement. It also helps us in pre-underwriting cases and that is increasing. So with data analytics it does have an impact on the way you underwrite, the speed at which you can underwrite and take to the transaction and reduce in a way cost of acquisition. I think we are in a decent position. It helps us in liabilities and assets and it helps in cross-sell. So, data, whoever utilises, will have a better chance.	1769		2	 100 million transactions happening through us, we should also, by corollary, understand that Rs.

66	\icici\dec-20.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  No, it is very, very difficult to say actually. This pent up also we don't know, who knows when demand falls off. I will only say, Abhishek, that our market share is low. So, we have headroom to grow. I would fall back more on market share rather than the demand coming up. Of course, if there is demand, it is easier to grow, as you know. It is difficult to see what is pent up. For example, stamp duty reduction, work from home and other factors are leading to demand for housing. If we look at our ticket sizes which are moving, that is also increasing. We were looking at our own data on salary, if you look at the number of people who are filing income taxes and if you look at the gradation of that on the salaries very   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 35 of 35 clearly you can compute what kind of ticket sizes will move on housing and what kind of ticket sizes will move on auto and then if you have good micro market data, which we have, then you can allocate your resources, attention and energy to that and get some shares. So, in general, that's the format that we are pursuing. We have been reasonably successful so far. I feel that if we continue, we will gain market shares as well. So, that is how I will put it, Abhishek. Moderator: Thank you very much. We will take that as the last question. I would now like to hand the conference back to the management team for closing comments.	1410		1	 We have been reasonably successful so far.  I will only say, Abhishek, that our market share is low.  So, in general, that's the format that we are pursuing. No, it is very, very difficult to say actually.  We were looking at our own data on salary, if you look at the number of people who are filing income taxes and if you look at the gradation of that on the salaries very   ICICI Bank Ltd January 30, 2021   Page 35 of 35 clearly you can compute what kind of ticket sizes will move on housing and what kind of ticket sizes will move on auto and then if you have good micro market data, which we have, then you can allocate your resources, attention and energy to that and get some shares.  Of course, if there is demand, it is easier to grow, as you know.	buying increase underperformed there wrong grow changed clear invest limited sense money statement say figures good failed comments different data right rise yes progress move struggled difficult comment not unclear positive history over	acquisitions decline increase underperformed increased there wrong fall statements changed clear negative grow here invest remarks resigned weakening increasing rising leaving money improving statement say today improvements expanded figures grown opportunities good follow slowing saying said comments different data right forecasts correct yes progress move contribute growing struggled difficult comment not changes unclear positive history over

72	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Sandeep Bakhshi 	  Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the results for Q3 of FY2022. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh and Anindya. We hope that you are safe and in good health. The Bank’s Ultra Frequency Index, comprising several high frequency indicators tracked by our Economic Research Group rose from 110.3 in end-October to 117.6 in December, indicating a sustained improvement in economic activity. This was on the back of improvement in indicators such as power demand, rail freight revenues, e-way bill generation and labour force participation. While there has been a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, the impact of the third wave has been mild so far. Vaccination coverage has continued to increase and the Government of India has recently expanded the vaccination programme to the age bracket of 15 to 18 and announced a precautionary third dose of vaccine for identified categories. While the trajectory of the pandemic is still evolving and the recent increase in cases has slowed the pace of economic activities in January, we expect the economy to regain momentum as this wave abates. We would like to thank the medical and health workers’ fraternity for their tireless effort in this fight against Covid-19. At ICICI Bank, we aim to create holistic value propositions for our customers through our 360-degree customer-centric approach and focus on opportunities across client and segment ecosystems. Our cross-functional teams seek to tap into key customer and market segments, enabling 360-degree coverage of customers and increase in wallet share. We aim to steadily grow our business within our strategic framework and strengthen our franchise, delivery, and servicing capabilities, backed by a range of digital initiatives. Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:        Page 3 of 28 First- Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the focused pursuit of target market segments. The core operating profit increased by 24.9% year-on-year to 100.60 billion Rupees in this quarter. The profit after tax grew by 25.4% year-on-year to 61.94 billion Rupees in this quarter. Second-Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise Growth in deposits was 16.4% year-on-year at December 31, 2021. During the quarter, average current account deposits increased by 33.7% year-on-year and average savings account deposits by 24.7% year-on-year. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was 130%, reflecting continued surplus liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system. Third-Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward The retail loan portfolio grew by 18.6% year-on-year and 5.1% sequentially at December 31, 2021. Disbursements across various retail products increased or were at a similar level compared to the previous quarter. The business banking portfolio grew by 38.5% year- on-year and 8.8% sequentially at December 31, 2021. The SME portfolio grew by 34.2% year-on-year and 9.7% sequentially. The growth in the domestic corporate portfolio was 12.5% year-on-year and 9.0% sequentially at December 31, 2021. The growth was driven by disbursements to well-rated corporates and in line with our risk framework. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 17.9% year-on-year and 6.5% sequentially. The overall loan portfolio grew by 16.4% year-on-year and 6.4% sequentially at December 31, 2021. Fourth-Leveraging digital across our business Our digital platforms are continuously evolving with the objective of creating end-to-end seamless digital journeys, offering personalised solutions and value added features to customers and enabling more effective data-driven cross-sell and up-sell. Our open architecture based mobile banking app, iMobile Pay, offers a wide variety of products,      Page 4 of 28 services and features and helps us to acquire new customers. The growth in our SME and business banking portfolios has been driven by our digital offerings and platforms like InstaBIZ and Merchant Stack. Our solutions for corporates comprising our various modular platforms, and our extensive client coverage have supported the growth in our average current account deposits. Process decongestion across products and customer segments is a key element of our strategy. We had made detailed presentations on these areas at our analyst day in December and have shared some details in slides 18 to 31 of the investor presentation. Fifth - Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks Net NPAs declined by 10.0% sequentially to 73.44 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021 from 81.61 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021. The net NPA ratio declined to 0.85% at December 31, 2021 from 0.99% at September 30, 2021. During the quarter, there were net deletions from gross NPAs of 1.91 billion Rupees, excluding write-offs and sale. The total provisions during the quarter were 20.07 billion Rupees or 20.0% of core operating profit and 1.01% of average advances. The provision coverage ratio on NPAs was 79.9% at December 31, 2021. In addition, the Bank continues to hold Covid-19 provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees or about 0.8% of total loans as of December 31, 2021. Sixth- Maintaining a strong capital base The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.64% at December 31, 2021, including profits for 9M of 2022. The Tier 1 ratio was 18.81% and the total capital adequacy ratio was 19.79% at December 31, 2021. Further, the market value of the Bank’s investments in listed entities of the Group is about 940 billion Rupees. Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to grow our core operating profit in a risk- calibrated manner. We are reimagining customer journeys with personalised and omni- channel experiences. Our ecosystem-based approach helps our customers to manage their business across the value chain efficiently, and has created new opportunities for us across businesses. We are investing in analytics capabilities and technology to enhance our offerings to customers and to build a robust future-ready architecture. We continue to be guided by the twin principles of “One Bank, One RoE”, emphasising the goal of maximizing our share of target market across all products and services and “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank”, emphasising the need to deliver fair value to customers while      Page 5 of 28 creating value for shareholders. We remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable returns to our shareholders.

73	\icici\dec-21.pdf	 Rakesh Jha 	  Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries. A. Balance sheet growth Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Coming to the growth across retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 23.3% year-on-year, rural loans by 9.4% and auto loans by 11.9%. The commercial vehicles and equipment portfolio declined by 2.8% year-on-year. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 25.3% year- on-year. This portfolio was 797.63 billion Rupees or 9.8% of the overall loan book at December 31, 2021. The overseas loan portfolio declined by 5.5% year-on-year and grew by 5.1% sequentially at December 31, 2021. The sequential increase in the overseas loan portfolio was primarily due to increase in the India-linked trade finance book. The overseas loan portfolio was 5.0% of the overall loan book at December 31, 2021. The non-India linked corporate portfolio reduced by 57.8% or about 941 million US Dollars year-on-year and 15.8% or about 129 million US Dollars sequentially, at December 31, 2021. We have provided the breakup of our overseas corporate portfolio on slide 16 of the investor presentation. Coming to the funding side: average savings account deposits increased by 24.7% year- on-year and 5.2% sequentially. Average current account deposits increased by 33.7% year-on-year and 11.9% sequentially. This quarter the flows related to IPOs and capital markets were high and contributed to the average current account balances. Total term deposits grew by 12.1% year-on-year to 5.4 trillion Rupees at December 31, 2021. B. Credit quality During the quarter, there were net deletions from gross NPAs of 1.91 billion Rupees compared to net additions of 0.96 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There were net additions of 1.26 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the retail and business banking portfolios and net deletions of 3.17 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the corporate and SME portfolios.      Page 6 of 28 The gross NPA additions declined to 40.18 billion Rupees in the current quarter from 72.31 billion Rupees in Q1 and 55.78 billion Rupees in Q2 this year. The gross NPA additions from the retail and business banking portfolio were 38.53 billion Rupees and from the corporate and SME portfolio were 1.65 billion Rupees. There were gross NPA additions of about 6.14 billion Rupees from the kisan credit card portfolio in the current quarter. We typically see higher NPA additions from the kisan credit card portfolio in the first and third quarter of a fiscal year. Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 42.09 billion Rupees. There were recoveries and upgrades of 37.27 billion Rupees from the retail and business banking portfolio and 4.82 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 40.88 billion Rupees. The Bank sold gross NPAs amounting to 1.05 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2022 on a cash basis. The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 36.38 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2021 compared to 37.14 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 19.57 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2021 on this non-fund based outstanding. The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers, under resolution as per various guidelines was 96.84 billion Rupees or about 1.2% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. Of the total fund based outstanding under resolution at December 31, 2021, 64.74 billion Rupees was from the retail and business banking portfolio and 32.10 billion Rupees was from the corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 24.36 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines. Over 95% of the loans under resolution in the retail and business banking portfolio are secured loans. C. P&L Details Net interest income increased by 23.4% year-on-year to 122.36 billion Rupees. Interest on income tax refund was 1.81 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 0.30 billion Rupees in the previous quarter and 1.96 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. The net interest margin was at 3.96% in this quarter compared to 4.00% in the previous quarter and 3.67% in Q3 of last year. The impact of interest on income tax refund on net interest margin was 6 bps in Q3 of this year compared to 1 bps in the previous quarter and 7 bps in Q3 of last year. The      Page 7 of 28 domestic NIM was at 4.06% this quarter compared to 4.09% in previous quarter and 3.78% in Q3 last year. Overseas margins were at 0.28%. The cost of deposits was 3.47% in Q3 compared to 3.53% in Q2. The sequential decline in net interest margin during the quarter was mainly due to decline in yield on advances, partly offset by decline in cost of deposits and higher interest on income tax refund. Of the total domestic loans, interest rates on 38% are linked to repo rate and 7% to other external benchmarks. Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 24.9% year-on-year to 48.99 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2022  Fee income increased by 19.2% year-on-year to 42.91 billion Rupees in Q3 driven by growth across various segments. Fees from retail, business banking and SME customers grew by 16.3% year-on-year and constituted about 76% of the total fees in this quarter.  Dividend income from subsidiaries and listed entities was 6.03 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 3.56 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. The dividend income this quarter includes interim dividend of ICICI General and higher interim dividend from ICICI Securities and ICICI AMC compared to Q3 of last year. On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 22.4% year-on-year in Q3 partially reflecting the slightly lower base of Q3 last year. The employee expenses increased by 27.4% year-on-year. The Bank had about 102,000 employees at December 31, 2021. The employee count has increased by about 9,900 in the last 12 months. Employee expenses in Q3 include an impact of about 0.69 billion Rupees due to fair valuation of ESOPs granted to all employees post April 1, 2021 for the current quarter as required by RBI guidelines. Non-employee expenses increased by 19.9% year-on-year in this quarter primarily due to retail business and technology related expenses. We continue to invest in technology to enhance our offerings to customers as well as the scalability, flexibility and resilience of our technology architecture. The technology expenses were about 8.4% of our operating expenses in 9M of 2022. The core operating profit increased by 24.9% year-on-year and 5.7% sequentially to 100.60 billion Rupees in this quarter.      Page 8 of 28 There was a treasury gain of 0.88 billion Rupees in Q3 compared to 3.97 billion Rupees in Q2 and 7.66 billion Rupees in Q3 of the previous year. Treasury income in Q3 of last year included gains of 3.29 billion Rupees from sale of shares of ICICI Securities. The total provisions during the quarter were 20.07 billion Rupees or 20.0% of core operating profit and 1.01% of average advances. The provisions this quarter include 4.65 billion Rupees of higher provision against security receipts and 4.47 billion Rupees of higher provision on loans under resolution on a prudent basis. There was no writeback of Covid-19 related provisions during the quarter. The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 79.9% as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we hold 24.36 billion Rupees of provisions on borrowers under resolution and Covid-19 related provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees. The Covid-19 provisions are about 0.8% of loans. At December 31, 2021, the total provisions, other than specific provisions on NPAs, were 160.26 billion Rupees or 2.0% of loans. The profit before tax grew by 33.9% year-on-year to 81.41 billion Rupees in this quarter from 60.78 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. The tax expense was 19.47 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 11.38 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit after tax grew by 25.4% year-on-year to 61.94 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 49.40 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. The consolidated profit after tax was 65.36 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 54.98 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. D. Growth in digital offerings Leveraging digital and technology across businesses is a key element of our strategy of growing the risk calibrated core operating profit. We have seen significant increase in the adoption of our mobile banking app, iMobile Pay. There have been 5.3 million activations of iMobile Pay by non-ICICI Bank account holders as of end-December. The value of transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders grew by 73% sequentially in Q3 of 2022. The value of credit card spends in Q3-2022 was 2.2 times the value of credit card spends in Q3-2021 and grew by 27% sequentially.      Page 9 of 28 The value of financial transactions on InstaBIZ grew by about 68% year-on-year in the current quarter. The value of transactions on the supply chain platforms in the current quarter was 3.5 times the value of transactions in Q3 last year. The proportion of end-to-end digital sanctions and disbursements across various products has been increasing steadily. About 33% of our mortgage sanctions and 43% of our personal loan disbursements, by volume, were end-to-end digital in 9M of 2022. About 95% of the overdraft facilities set up for business banking current account customers were end-to-end digital in 9M of 2022. The Bank had launched ICICI STACK for corporates and has created more than 20 industry specific STACKs which provide bespoke and purpose-based digital solutions to corporate clients and their ecosystems. The volume of transactions through these solutions in Q3- 2022 was 3.7 times the volume of tranasctions in Q3-2021. The Bank recently launched TradeEmerge for importers and exporters across India, offering banking as well as value-added services. This initiative makes cross border trade hassle-free, quick and convenient, as it offers an array of services in one place. E. Portfolio information We have been growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward. Our retail portfolio has been built based on proprietary data and analytics in addition to bureau checks, utilising the existing customer database for sourcing in key retail asset products through cross sell and up-sell and pricing in relation to the risk.

Otherwise, I think across segments, we have been seeing a reasonably good growth in fee revenues.	388		2	 Of course, we have to keep track of regulatory changes or market changes.

81	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  It's a continuing journey on technology and digital and expenses as we expand our offerings. If you look at the last few years, I think we have always cited that within expenses, technology has been one of the expenses that have been growing at a faster pace than the overall expenses. So, this is 8% of operating expenses, if you go back three years, it would have definitely been a lower number. We will see some increase in that proportion, but of course, we are not looking at 3% of revenues going up to 9% or 10%. I think that's a completely different cost base which is there, completely different infrastructure setup which is there. So, those numbers may not be comparable for the Indian banks.	704		0	 If you look at the last few years, I think we have always cited that within expenses, technology has been one of the expenses that have been growing at a faster pace than the overall expenses.

85	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  On the trade side, definitely, we see a huge opportunity across our business segments, on the small business side as well as the larger corporates. We have been leveraging our digital offerings also to scale up that business. You would have seen that even in our overseas business, we have seen the increase has come from the trade finance book. Domestically also, both trade-related short-term book as well as LCs are key contributors for us and the growth there has been quite good for us and we would assume that would continue to be a strong driver for the fee income as well which Mahrukh was earlier talking about and it kind of fits in very well with our overall approach of capturing the entire customer 360 and the ecosystem. On the pre-owned cars, clearly, that is something where the yields are better and the overall ROEs are better if the credit costs are contained. But, definitely there is some bit of higher risk as well. So, we would want an optimal proportion of pre-owned cars in our car loan business. Nothing specific to highlight there. We are very happy to grow that business and the proportion for us has been increasing as well. It is an important component especially from an overall car loan business profitability point of      Page 15 of 28 view.

89	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  On the credit card, there are sort of a couple of things that we are doing which is leading to slightly better growth. One is on the retail segment itself. We are doing much more intense activity on the portfolio in the sense that what are the customer behaviours, where are they behaving and whatever spends we have to do on activation or spends that we have to do on rewards and other things, we are ensuring that every rupee that we are spending, it is matching with the customer behaviour or what we think will be the customer behaviour so that the return on those investments are good. We don't see it as expenses, we are actually seeing it as return on investments, from every rupee invested how much return is going to come. Second, we also had good help from Amazon as you know. The portfolio risk is very little, the spends are very high and the quality of customers is also very high. The third one, there is a nice portfolio that is getting built up on the commercial cards. So, these are the three big drivers that are happening. We saw that in the first wave and then second wave, the revolver rate actually came down a little bit and now it is again      Page 16 of 28 coming up. We'll have to see how it pans out during the third wave. But indeed, the revolver did come down and people did get conservative on that. So, as of now this is the situation of cards. We are now seeing that the impact of the third wave is not very large. The spends during the festive season and were very strong. After this wave gets over, I think it will be back to where we were and life will be good.	1599		2	 We are now seeing that the impact of the third wave is not very large.

We are doing much more intense activity on the portfolio in the sense that what are the customer behaviours, where are they behaving and whatever spends we have to do on activation or spends that we have to do on rewards and other things, we are ensuring that every rupee that we are spending, it is matching with the customer behaviour or what we think will be the customer behaviour so that the return on those investments are good.	behind over complete increase neutral underperformed answered there changed done clear invest here ticker removed release show confidential money reported statement today figures coming orders opportunities good benefit saying said playing comments overweight right correct working yes progress investments contribute below positive doing	behind acquisitions increase underperformed happened there fall grow changed clear invest here doing remarks high nothing money great statement continue return problems good profit saying benefit said comments different overweight right correct working yes progress investments growing contribute comment not unclear positive over

93	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  I will just respond on the retail side and then hand it over to Rakesh. We have been sharing with you a lot of work that we are doing on the pre-delinquency management. On the pre- delinquency management, there is a lot of data that we have such as which are the customers that are most likely to bounce and where you should collect and if there is an overdue, which are the sectors, which are the profiles of the customers with higher chances of recovery due to presence of cash flows. So, we are able to allocate our energy and resources towards collections efficiently and that has really helped us and we are improving those models by the day. With more data, the machine learns more and the pre-delinquency management get better. That has certainly contributed a lot to our recoveries. Because at this point of time, if there is cash which is coming with the customers, depending on who reaches first, they get repaid. As the stress in the economy      Page 17 of 28 comes down, of course, everybody will get repaid. But when there is a stress in the economy and you are going for collection, it is important that if there is one call to be made, which is a customer, where you have the highest probability of collection, the call should go there. So, on the retail side essentially, those are the recoveries. Also, as for us, we have always been maintaining that the consumer behaviour is that it goes overdue, but it comes back. So, there are two reasons why customers go overdue, one is because of their own cash flow stress, the second one sometimes once in a while is on account of intent. Our experience is that the intent percentage is really very low. All customers want to pay back and when they want to pay back, we have seen that there is a cashflow mismatch. So, partly you can give them restructuring. If you think that it is only a temporary loss of income, and they are going to come back, and you also do pre-delinquency management and collections, data analytics that you have done so that you are able to allocate your resources well for collections. So, that has certainly given us the flip. On the balance part, I just request Rakesh to elaborate.	2174		2	 All customers want to pay back and when they want to pay back, we have seen that there is a cashflow mismatch.

So, near term, of course, it will depend on how things pan out. We don't want to give any specific guidance on the credit cost per se, but in second quarter, we had said that second half, we do expect the level of gross additions to come down from what we have seen in the first half, specifically the first quarter, and the trend has been in line with that.	597		0	 So, near term, of course, it will depend on how things pan out.

SME again for at least the last two and a half years, we have seen that growth. Of course, it has to do with the market opportunity, which is there for us to grow. Additionally, it also reflects the sharp focus that we have put on these business segments and the fact that we have been leveraging our branches a lot more in the past few years. This also has got driven by the kind of streamlining of processes that we have done in terms of customer acquisition, onboarding, underwriting. So, all those steps which we have taken kind of enabled us to grow at this pace. The strong underpinning of technology and digital of course is there because that is something that ensures that we are able to attract customers. A lot of this business that we are doing is with existing customers of the Bank also. As we acquire business from branches, there have been customers who have had current accounts with us, but we have not had a lending relationship with them. So, all of that is something which is really helping us in this growth. We are focused in terms of ensuring that we meet our risk and return thresholds. We look at the granularity and ensure that there is good collateral and exposure is widespread across sectors. All of this is what has really been driving growth for us.

The lending related fees there is much lesser. The third party distribution fees for us that would be growing at somewhat slower pace than the overall fees.

I think, given the surplus liquidity in the system and overall, loan growth for the system is indeed still running at around 8% to 9% kind of level. So, that is something which has impacted the yield and it is there for all the banks that we have seen. In the near term, like we had said last quarter, our first half NIM was about 3.94% and we had talked about protecting our NIM at around that level in the near term, and that's what our focus is. There are a lot of moving parts. I think on the deposit side, the deposit costs have bottomed out for banks. On the lending side, maybe there is still some further pressure which could be there. The surplus liquidity in the balance sheet, as that keeps getting deployed, I think that will be a positive as well. And then of course, how the overall market rates and repo rate move will      Page 22 of 28 also impact.

120	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Mahesh, I think, we will have to look at it slightly more from a medium to long term perspective. In the near term, of course, we have seen a lot of deletions from NPLs coming      Page 23 of 28 in. It also reflects the fact that we did add a fair bit of NPLs last year and in the first quarter this year. This trend of deletions at some stage will definitely slow down as well. So, as of now, I think we would kind of stay with our long term estimates for credit cost. In the near term, yes, it could end up under-shooting that. That is always a possibility, but let us see. In terms of the point that you are saying on the risk aspect of it, I think that is something, which we always look at it from risk and return thresholds together. That's why we have been happy to grow credit card book or personal loan book as well. Aside from the fact that because of the pandemic the growth has been much lower over the last six quarters or so in this portfolio. As you are aware, prior to Covid, that book was growing at close to 40% on a year-on-year basis. Unfortunately, the third wave has happened, otherwise, things were kind of getting back to a much more normal level. As Anup mentioned earlier, as things normalize, we will see more increase in some of these segments, where the customers are also happy to take some of these loans, which are more from a discretionary perspective. We will always evaluate that in terms of the portfolio.	1443		0	 As you are aware, prior to Covid, that book was growing at close to 40% on a year-on-year basis.

122	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Yes, we would. Again, it is nothing to do with the historic book. One has to look at what your underwriting is on an incremental basis. What we look at is the final contribution to the core operating profit and the related credit costs. Those are the two things that we look at. So, especially on the retail side, the net interest income piece, expenses, sourcing cost, credit cost, all of these are variables, which we are happy to use to optimize the return on the portfolio. So, that's definitely something that we would look at. Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Aakriti Kakkar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.	636		1	 So, especially on the retail side, the net interest income piece, expenses, sourcing cost, credit cost, all of these are variables, which we are happy to use to optimize the return on the portfolio.

So, just wanted to understand, there's been      Page 24 of 28 clearly a compression on yields and given where the yields are, how are you thinking about it in terms of making money on this product? This question actually is not only about mortgages, but also in terms of the cross-sell opportunities that are available thorugh the mortgage customers.

124	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  So, pricing on the mortgage side, is always competitive. I think we are very clear that we don't want to be price leaders in any of the segments including mortgages. But, if we see the market rates where they are, we would be happy to be at par because, indeed, it's a sticky product, you acquire good long term value customers. We are happy to match the lending rates that are there. It's not that we will go and do our entire business at the headline rates which are there. We look at the portfolio, we look at the risk and we kind of work out what are the yields that will work for us from a portfolio perspective. We also factor in the overall customer profitability, not just from the mortgage business. At times, we also look at the mortgage plus the loan against property business in aggregate to see where our overall returns are. The good thing with the mortgage book is that all of this is floating rate linked to repo rate. So, at some stage as the funding costs go up, those yields will also kind of go up, but there can definitely be a lag between that happening. We will continue to focus on the mortgage book and that is an important book for us to grow and we will be competitive in terms of pricing there, though we will not be price leaders.	1261		2	So, pricing on the mortgage side, is always competitive.

I think the spends market share has really picked up nicely, but the number of cards is like in a particular band of 17% to 18%, so, does it mean that the spends Anup talked about, the partnership with Amazon has been pretty good? So, cards have become more productive given the spends per card, the market share gain over there is much higher. So, just trying to understand, what explains the sharp pick up in the market share on spends versus the number of cards?

128	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  As I said earlier, there are three drivers. There is normal retail where sharper portfolio management is driving the spends. With Amazon, the good thing is that the activation rates are quick. So, if there is a card, the customers generally immediately start the spends. Here, really the S curve is very steep. That is the second thing. And third is on the commercial cards side, there is an improvement. So, these are the three drivers of card spends. And they seem to be quite secular and customers are activating. I must also add to what Rakesh was saying, overall, I think the dispensation of customers, because of whatever is happening within our Bank and with the help of our brand, we are sensing that customer propensity to also take our cards or come to us and do more business with us is also increasing. Of course, while we are working hard, I must say that customers are also tilting a bit towards us because of the brand and because of the positivity of the Bank at this point of time.	1000		2	 Of course, while we are working hard, I must say that customers are also tilting a bit towards us because of the brand and because of the positivity of the Bank at this point of time.

135	\icici\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Karfa 	  Hi Rakesh, I'll go back to the question of Mahesh, but let me frame it a little differently. Obviously, the credit cost is going down quite sharply. Given the construct of the loan book, everybody seems to believe that as the repo rate kicks in, we will get a benefit. Cost ratios are broadly going to be okay. Reality is that banking is a cyclical basis.  The problems that I potentially see, and I'm probably feeding this answer, is a very lopsided kind of growth in the overall loans of the system. In my opinion, it looks to me that banks are enjoying a very good pricing power, at least at this point of time. Would you therefore want to believe or give us a sense that it is probably the margins, which will have a fair amount of pressure going forward? That could also be from your perspective, because if growth remains like this, banks would typically prefer to get into a volume-driven growth than a unit economics of the growth.

Of course, this is resettable and this is one year and all of it, but finally it is a long- term floating rate loan.

144	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya’s opening remarks 	  Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.  A. Balance Sheet growth Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Coming to the growth across retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 19.1% year-on-year and 4% sequentially. Auto loans grew by 22% year-on-year and 5.9% sequentially. The commercial vehicles and equipment portfolio grew by 3.4% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 44.8% year-on-year and 7.2% sequentially. This portfolio was 1,154.78 billion Rupees or 11.9% of the overall loan book at December 31, 2022.  The overseas loan portfolio, in US dollar terms, declined by 22.1% year-on-year and 8.7% sequentially at December 31, 2022. The decline in the overseas book primarily reflects maturities of the short-term India-linked trade book. The overseas loan portfolio was about 3.6% of the overall loan book at December 31, 2022. The non-India linked corporate portfolio declined by 42.8% or about 285 million US dollars on a year-on-year basis. Of the overseas corporate portfolio, about 86% comprises Indian corporates, 8% is overseas corporates with Indian linkage, 3% comprises companies owned by NRIs or PIOs and balance 3% is non-India corporates.   Page 5 of 19   On the liabilities side, Sandeep covered the growth in deposits. During the quarter, we raised long-term infrastructure bonds as well as refinance borrowings from domestic financial institutions. Overseas borrowings declined reflecting the reduction in assets. We also had bond maturities arising out of older capital instruments during the quarter.  B. Credit quality There were net additions of 11.19 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the current quarter compared to 6.05 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The net additions to gross NPAs were 9.75 billion Rupees in the retail, rural and business banking portfolios and 1.44 billion Rupees in the corporate and SME portfolio.  The gross NPA additions were 57.23 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 43.66 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The gross NPA additions from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio were 41.59 billion Rupees and from the corporate and SME portfolio were 15.64 billion Rupees. There were gross NPA additions of about 6.72 billion Rupees from the Kisan Credit Card portfolio in the current quarter. We typically see higher NPA additions from the Kisan Credit Card portfolio in the first and third quarter of a fiscal year. Corporate and SME gross NPA additions includes 8.05 billion Rupees on account of borrowers that were under resolution at September 30, 2022. The Bank held about 35% provisions against these borrowers.  Recoveries and upgrades from gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 46.04 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 37.61 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 31.84 billion Rupees from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 14.20 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 11.62 billion Rupees. There was no sale of NPAs in the current quarter compared to 0.94 billion Rupees of NPAs sold on a cash basis in the previous quarter.  Net NPAs declined by 23.1% year-on-year and 7.3% sequentially to 56.51 billion Rupees at December 31, 2022.  The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 38.69 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2022 compared to 35.16 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2022. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 19.93 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2022 against this non-fund based outstanding.    Page 6 of 19  The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers under resolution as per various guidelines declined to 49.87 billion Rupees or about 0.5% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 from 67.13 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2022. Of the total fund based outstanding under resolution at December 31, 2022, 41.90 billion Rupees was from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 7.97 billion Rupees was from the corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 15.29 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines. Moving on to the P&L details:  C. P&L Details Net interest income increased by 34.6% year-on-year to 164.65 billion Rupees. The net interest margin was 4.65% in this quarter compared to 4.31% in the previous quarter and 3.96% in Q3 of last year. The net interest margin was 4.33% in 9 months of 2023. There was no impact of interest on income tax refund on net interest margin in the current quarter. The domestic NIM was at 4.79% this quarter compared to 4.45% in the previous quarter and 4.06% in Q3 last year. The cost of deposits was 3.65% in this quarter compared to 3.55% in the previous quarter. Of the total domestic loans, interest rates on 45% are linked to the repo rate, 4% to other external benchmarks and 21% to MCLR and other older benchmarks. The balance 30% of loans have fixed interest rates. The sequential increase in NIM reflects the impact of increase in interest rates on loan yields while repricing of deposits occurs with a lag. We expect to see the impact of repricing of deposits in future quarters.  Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 1.8% year-on-year to 49.87 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2023   Fee income increased by 3.7% year-on-year to 44.48 billion Rupees in this quarter. Fees from retail, rural, business banking and SME customers grew by 7.3% year- on-year and constituted about 78% of the total fees in this quarter   Dividend income from subsidiaries and associates was 5.16 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 6.03 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. The dividend income in Q3 of last year included interim dividend from ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 16.1% year-on-year in this quarter. Employee expenses increased by 17.6% year-on-year. The Bank had about 117,200 employees at December 31, 2022. The employee count has increased by about 15,300 in the last 12 months. Non-employee expenses increased by 15.4% year-on-year in this quarter primarily due to technology and retail business related expenses. Our branch count has increased by about 420 in the last twelve months and we had 5,718 branches as of December 31, 2022. The technology expenses were about 9.3% of our operating expenses in 9 months of this year compared to about 8.6% in FY2022.   Page 7 of 19   The core operating profit increased by 31.6% year-on-year to 132.35 billion Rupees in this quarter. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries and associates, the core operating profit grew by 34.5% year-on-year.  There was a treasury gain of 0.36 billion Rupees in Q3 compared to a loss of 0.85 billion Rupees in Q2 and a gain of 0.88 billion Rupees in Q3 of the previous year.  The total provisions during the quarter, including impact of change in provisioning norms, were 22.57 billion Rupees, or 17.06% of core operating profit and 0.93% of average advances. These include contingency provisions of 15 billion Rupees made on a prudent basis.  The provisioning coverage on NPAs was 82% as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we hold 15.29 billion Rupees of provisions on borrowers under resolution. Further, the Bank holds contingency provision of 115 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the total provisions, other than specific provisions on fund-based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing, were 213.40 billion Rupees or 2.2% of loans.  The profit before tax grew by 35.3% year-on-year to 110.14 billion Rupees in this quarter. The tax expense was 27.02 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 19.47 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit after tax grew by 34.2% year-on-year to 83.12 billion Rupees in this quarter.  The consolidated profit after tax grew by 34.5% year-on-year to 87.92 billion Rupees in this quarter.  D. Growth in digital offerings Leveraging digital and technology across businesses is a key element of our strategy for growing the risk-calibrated core operating profit. We continue to see increasing adoption and usage of our digital platforms by our customers.

Portfolio information We have provided details on our retail, business banking and SME portfolio in slides 35 to 45 of the investor presentation.  The loan and non-fund based outstanding to performing corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and below was 55.81 billion Rupees at December 31, 2022 compared to 76.38 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022 and 118.42 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2021. The sequential decline was primarily due to slippage of borrowers that were under resolution into NPA and a few repayments during the quarter. The amount of 55.81 billion Rupees at December 31, 2022 includes 8.79 billion Rupees of outstanding to borrowers under resolution.  The maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 5 billion Rupees at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, we held provisions of 4.48 billion Rupees on the BB and below portfolio compared to 8.12 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022.

The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 765.4 billion Rupees at December 31, 2022 compared to 735.73 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022. The total outstanding loans to NBFCs and HFCs were about 7% of our advances at December 31. The sequential increase in the outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was mainly due to disbursements to entities having longer vintage and entities owned by well-established corporate groups.  The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans and working capital was 360.11 billion Rupees at December 31, 2022 compared to 319.63 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022. The builder portfolio is about 3.4% of our total loan portfolio. Our portfolio is largely to well-established builders and this is also reflected in the sequential increase in the portfolio. 5.6% of our builder portfolio at December 31, 2022 was either rated BB and below internally or was classified as non-performing, compared to 6.8% at September 30, 2022.

145	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Mahrukh Adajania 	  So I had a couple of questions. Firstly, that would you say that the sequential growth, because you lend to so many segments, the sequential growth has peaked at around, say, 4% Q-o-Q. Would that be a fair assumption? Because there will always be some moving parts. The sector growth is also on a very high base? 	315		1	Firstly, that would you say that the sequential growth, because you lend to so many segments, the sequential growth has peaked at around, say, 4% Q-o-Q.

146	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  No, I think it really can't be expressed in that way. There are, as you said, moving parts in different quarters. So for example, in this year, the festive season was kind of split between Q2 and Q3, it started a bit early. So some of the consumption-related growth would have happened partly in Q2 instead of happening fully in Q3.  The way we look at it, I think, in terms of, if you look at the granular portfolio, which is retail, business banking etc. the disbursement volumes are pretty much holding up and the loan growth will be really an outcome of that. So that's the way we would look at it. 	605		1	 So some of the consumption-related growth would have happened partly in Q2 instead of happening fully in Q3.

147	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Mahrukh Adajania  	  And so if loan growth accelerates in the fourth quarter, would there be enough deposits? I know that you've done borrowings as well, but the deposit growth on an overall basis is 3%. So, on a sequential basis. I mean, would there be enough deposits to fund higher growth, how is the system shaping up? 	304		1	And so if loan growth accelerates in the fourth quarter, would there be enough deposits.

148	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 Yes. I think a lot of focus goes on this year-on-year deposit growth versus credit growth gap, which kind of misses the fact that the first 2 quarters of the calendar year were quarters when banks had and then ran down significant excess liquidity. Liquidity in the system itself has come down from INR 8 trillion to under INR 1 trillion. So it has to be seen in that context. I think the way we've analyzed it is if we look at the net increase in the balance sheet, say, in the third quarter, borrowings represent only about 10% or 11% of the funding accretion and the balance is really coming through deposits and equity or the profit generation. So we don't see deposits or funding as a constraint at all. During the quarter we have grown our total deposit base by over INR 300 billion and as we had mentioned last time, as the retail deposit rates have started moving up, we've seen a pretty healthy increase in the accretion to retail deposits and that momentum is continuing. So we are quite comfortable on the funding side. And for Q3, we had an LCR of 123% average for the quarter.

149	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Mahrukh Adajania  	  And my next question is on contingent provisions. So a few banks or at least two private banks have been telling us that they have some sort of a deadline from auditors or some sort of feedback from auditors that it has to be utilized within a certain period and therefore some of them are cutting down contingency provisions. So how does that work with you in terms of auditor’s timeline because you're just building on the buffer? 	435		1	And my next question is on contingent provisions.

150	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  I'm not aware of such a requirement. The way we look at the contingency provisions is that we certainly see the various developments that are taking place both globally and in India that could impact various parts of the portfolio and then we do an analysis of the portfolio where there is no NPL development currently but the risk markers could be a little higher than the average and then that's how we kind of build-up on the contingency provision and that's something that we would keep revisiting every quarter as we've said earlier.  Moderator:    Next question is from the line of Jignesh from InCred Capital.  Jignesh:   I just had two questions itself. One, as I see it in the presentation the rise in cost of deposits sequentially has been somewhere around 10 bps, if I see it correct. How do you see that panning forward? How that particular trend looks to be? Second, your cost to income has seen a significant improvement of roughly around 38% right now, 38.2%. What kind of trajectory are you seeing up on this segment also if you can highlight? 	1062		2	 One, as I see it in the presentation the rise in cost of deposits sequentially has been somewhere around 10 bps, if I see it correct.

151	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  On the first question I think what has happened in this cycle is that the wholesale deposit rates moved up first pretty sharply starting from May and we have not been large takers in the wholesale deposit market. The retail deposit rates started moving much more gradually and much later. So the larger rise in retail deposit rates has come only actually from September onwards. So if you look at for example, the peak retail term deposit rate that we are offering today is about 115 basis points compared to what it was a quarter ago. So that is why the repricing of retail deposits is happening with a lag, these are more granular in any case so they do get repriced over a period of time but as I had mentioned in the opening remarks, we would expect to see the cost of deposits go up at a sharper pace going forward.    Page 12 of 19  Jignesh:     And on the cost to income? 	881		2	 So if you look at for example, the peak retail term deposit rate that we are offering today is about 115 basis points compared to what it was a quarter ago.

152	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  On the second part, I think we don't really manage that ratio. We are looking at the overall PPOP and PPOP growth and we continue to invest in technology, branches and people. So as it happened this quarter the opex growth was a little lower on a year-on-year basis than the trend that we've seen over the last couple of quarters and so cost to income has come down to 38%. But it's going to be in that range I would say, around 40%. I don't think we are looking at any major moves there.  Jignesh:   One quick question on contingency provision, which is INR 115 billion right now as on December. Is there any target that this you want to introduce as a balance or it can vary every quarter? I mean any specific number in your mind? Or how does it work? 	756		0	 So as it happened this quarter the opex growth was a little lower on a year-on-year basis than the trend that we've seen over the last couple of quarters and so cost to income has come down to 38%.

If I were to adjust the historically high level of international loans probably on domestic book, you will be close to peak LDR that you have been. So going back to the earlier question, while I will appreciate the borrowing part, till what level are you seeing the LDR and beyond which deposit growth could start becoming a concern for loan growth? 	397		1	 If I were to adjust the historically high level of international loans probably on domestic book, you will be close to peak LDR that you have been.

155	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  Yes, you are right. If you leave aside the overseas balance sheet, the loan-to-deposit ratio is at 85% and which is at the higher end of the historical range. But as I explained earlier, we don’t see the deposit growth really as a constraint. I think if you look at the accretion to deposits on a quarter-on-quarter basis, it has been going up quite smartly as we have moved the rates in line with the system broadly. We were slower in the initial part of the year because we had significant excess liquidity to start with.   Page 13 of 19   But while there is a natural level at which the loan-to-deposit ratio will settle again, we don't over-worry about it because as we've mentioned in the past a three-month wholesale deposit makes that ratio lower, whereas a two-year refinance borrowing makes it higher. So we would look at the overall quality of funding. But all forms of wholesale funding are essentially the marginal source of funding. The core funding remains the retail deposits and we are seeing pretty healthy momentum there. 	1042		0	 Page 13 of 19   But while there is a natural level at which the loan-to-deposit ratio will settle again, we don't over-worry about it because as we've mentioned in the past a three-month wholesale deposit makes that ratio lower, whereas a two-year refinance borrowing makes it higher.

If at all on the personal loan side, I think that concern is a little bit on the pricing where the market has become quite competitive. But from a credit perspective, we are very comfortable on both portfolios.  Moderator:    The next question is from the line of Adarsh from CLSA India.  Adarsh:   I just wanted to check on the fee growth. Is this 3% fee growth a fairly widespread representation of growth or because of third-party slower insurance, different elements would have a different growth trajectory? How does one see from a medium-term perspective? 	736		1	 But from a credit perspective, we are very comfortable on both portfolios.

158	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  There are actually quite a few factors here, Adarsh. One, is that we don't particularly focus on it as a line item because we are focused on the overall PPOP, risk-calibrated PPOP growth as our guiding metric. If you look at the fee number for this quarter, again, there is some impact of the festival seasonality. There is, as you rightly pointed out a de-growth year-on-year in the third-party distribution led fees, which one would have to adjust for. In addition to that, I think if you look at a couple of other areas for example, the loan processing fee where there is, A, a competitive element and B, we also are more focused on making sure that we have the appropriate loan yield rather than maximizing upfront fees.   Page 14 of 19   In certain products from our overall perspective of customer fairness, we have also rationalized or reduced substantially the exit penalties like the prepayment premiums and foreclosure charges on certain categories of loans, for example a personal loan or an auto loan which is at least somewhat seasoned or business banking where the borrower has been with us for a couple of years and for whatever reason wishes to exit, we would charge lower or no penalty is the way we would look at it because it is the borrower relationship which is important.  In all of these if we adjust the fee growth would be a few percentage points higher than what is the reported number. Having said that, of course, there are areas where we can do better for example, FX or transaction banking, these are some of the areas where we believe we have excellent platforms and we need to leverage those to grow our share and our revenue but that's the overall kind of range which we would get it. So it should hopefully improve from the current level over a period of time. But there are many things we are doing within that to make sure that rather than getting fixated on this number, we really manage it in a way that contributes to the sustainable growth of the franchise.  Adarsh:   My second last question is for FY2024 and FY2025, if you think about margins peaking about at some point, next year would be a relatively tough year from a core operating profits scenario. One can ignore it and say that let's look at two, three-year CAGR. The second is, do you have levers on the opex side, because the last two to three years opex post-COVID has been, there's been a lot of investment. So just wanted to understand if that lever can be of use when margins kind of normalize? 	2504		2	 In addition to that, I think if you look at a couple of other areas for example, the loan processing fee where there is, A, a competitive element and B, we also are more focused on making sure that we have the appropriate loan yield rather than maximizing upfront fees.

So just wanted to understand if that lever can be of use when margins kind of normalize.  So it should hopefully improve from the current level over a period of time.	complete decline increase neutral been underperformed there stable fall grow changed done clear invest here increasing gone money statement figures spend good said improve comments different right correct yes adjustments margins progress investments contribute bearish unclear positive over	buying acquisitions complete exited decline increase neutral underperformed been drop there wrong stable concerned mistake changed done clear grow here invest fall increasing important gone sense money reported products statement expanded figures calculations mixed good benefit saying said improve comments different growth right correct rise yes adjustments margins change progress contribute struggled bearish adjust not changes unclear positive stabilized history over

But we will see as we go along, it depends on how we look at incremental lending, funding and the levers that we have to try and optimize the balance sheet and of course, all other elements of the PPOP so we'll take that as it comes.

161	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  We have not reported the quarter end LCR, the reporting is on a quarterly average basis, but I would say it would be broadly at similar levels. The trajectory that liquidity follows is typically pretty strong at month end, then during the month, deposit withdrawals happen, say on the savings side, in particular quarters there are advance tax outflows and so on when the system goes tight on liquidity and then it builds up again. That's why we look at the average but the quarter end would not be materially different from the reported number of 123% average for the quarter.  On the provisioning policy the RBI norms prescribe a minimum provisioning policy and on the retail and rural loans, we already follow a more conservative provisioning norm where we provide for NPAs on a more accelerated basis. For the corporate, SME and business banking portfolio we were applying the RBI norm and we thought that it would be prudent to do some acceleration there as well, both in terms of the period over which we reach 100% coverage and also in the earlier buckets.

163	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  We will have to wait and see, because clearly on the corporate side the loan growth this year partly has come from because of the sharp pricing of liquidity and some shift from bond markets and so on. We have seen higher borrowings or higher appetite for borrowings from some of the segments like NBFC which explain a reasonable portion of the corporate loan growth. As I said, our feeling is that the retail loan volumes are quite steady. So that part of the growth should sustain. On the corporate side, we will have to wait and see. We will just look at our own analysis of risk reward and profitability and how to optimize our PPOP, that will be our guiding factor without targeting a particular level of loan growth. But on the retail SME business banking side, I don't see a challenge in the loan volumes.  On the capex, clearly a fair amount of capex is happening, which has been undertaken and funded by the government and the public sector. There is investment happening from the private sector in real estate and there is some amount of investment happening from the private sector in infrastructure and industrials as well. But so far it has not been of a level which would move the needle on domestic loan growth. We'll have to see how it shapes up. While it's good from a credit perspective the issue from a loan demand perspective is that most corporates are extremely well funded and liquid and are therefore, able to undertake some amount of investment without having recourse to banks. So what is coming to banks is more granular in nature.  Abhishek:   And assuming that this loan growth moderates a little bit next year. And you also, started to coincide with NIM normalizing as well. What can you do on the rest of the lines, like fee or cost to protect PPOP growth?

164	\icici\dec-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	  We will see it as it comes. We’re not seeing any sharp deceleration in loan growth. Our loan growth has been quite sustainably in the high teens. Of course, when the system loan growth itself, it reached mid to higher teens, it went about 20%. So it may come off a little, but that's okay. And we would look at ways to achieve a stable level of profitability. Current year's operating profit growth is, of course, much higher than what a normal level would be, because of a sharp rise in interest rates. But I think there are many levers available in the balance sheet and the P&L, which can be optimized.  Abhishek:   A very quick question on fees. I understand that you've changed a lot of rates on fees but from the current point onwards, should it track loan growth and loan mix? Or do you still see more fees getting rationalized and therefore, you could still continue to see some pressure on fee to assets or fee to loans? 	932		2	 And we would look at ways to achieve a stable level of profitability.

174	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh’s opening remarks 	  Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, capital adequacy, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.  A. Balance sheet growth  The overall loan portfolio grew by 17.0% year-on-year at June 30, 2021. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 19.6% year-on-year and 0.3% sequentially at June 30, 2021. Up to the last quarter, we used to report business banking as a part of the retail portfolio. From this quarter, we are excluding it from the retail portfolio and reporting it separately. The retail portfolio grew by 20.2% year-on-year and 0.7% sequentially. Within the retail portfolio, the mortgage loan portfolio grew by 24.0% year-on-year, rural loans by 24.2%, commercial vehicle and equipment loans by 1.5% and the auto loan portfolio by 15.0%. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 13.5% year-on-year. This portfolio was 666.26 billion Rupees or 9.0% of the overall loan book at June 30, 2021.    ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 9 of 38 The business banking portfolio grew by 53.4% year-on-year and 6.3% sequentially at June 30, 2021. The SME business comprising borrowers with a turnover of less than 2.5 billion Rupees grew by 42.8% year-on-year and decreased by 1.7% sequentially to 297.78 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021.  The growth of the domestic corporate portfolio was 11.4% year-on-year. The growth in performing domestic corporate portfolio, excluding the builder portfolio, was about 15% year-on-year at June 30, 2021 driven by disbursements to higher rated corporates and PSUs across various sectors to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements.  The overseas loan portfolio declined by 14.7% year-on-year and increased by 6.7% sequentially at June 30, 2021. The sequential increase in the overseas loan portfolio was primarily due to increase in the India-linked trade finance book. The overseas loan portfolio was 5.4% of the overall loan book at June 30, 2021. The non-India linked corporate portfolio reduced by 58.8% or about 1.4 billion US Dollars year-on-year and 21.6% or about 270 million US Dollars sequentially, at June 30, 2021. We have provided the breakup of our overseas corporate portfolio on slide 16 of the investor presentation.  Coming to the funding side: We continue to focus on growing the daily average CASA balances and retail term deposits. Average savings account deposits increased by 21.7% year-on-year and average current account deposits increased by 32.4% year-on-year during the quarter. There could be some impact on the sequential growth in current account deposits in the next quarter due to the implementation of RBI’s guideline on opening of current accounts by banks. Total term deposits grew by 8.7% year-on-year to 5.0 trillion Rupees at June 30, 2021.  B. Credit quality  The gross NPA additions were 72.31 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 55.23 billion Rupees on a proforma basis in Q4 of 2021. Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 36.27 billion rupees which was about 50.0% of the gross NPA additions during the quarter. The gross NPA additions from the retail and business banking portfolio were 67.73 billion Rupees in the current quarter   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 10 of 38 compared to 43.55 billion Rupees on a proforma basis in Q4 of 2021. The retail and business banking gross NPA additions included additions of 9.61 billion Rupees from the kisan credit card portfolio and 11.30 billion Rupees from the jewel loan portfolio. As Sandeep mentioned earlier, we expect near complete recoveries from the jewel loan portfolio in the coming quarters. We typically see gross NPA additions from kisan credit card portfolio in the first and third quarter of the fiscal year. The gross NPA additions from the kisan credit card portfolio were relatively low last year due to moratorium extended to the borrowers from March to August. The kisan credit card portfolio and jewel loan portfolio were about 3% each of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2021. In the retail and business banking gross NPA additions, excluding rural, the proportion of mortgages was similar to FY2021, commercial vehicle and equipment loans was higher and personal loans and credit cards was lower.  The gross NPA additions from the corporate and SME portfolio were 4.58 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 11.68 billion Rupees on a proforma basis in Q4 of 2021. Proforma corporate and SME NPA additions in the previous quarter included one account in the construction sector which was rated BB and below at December 31 and was classified as non-performing during Q4 and upgraded in the same quarter post the implementation by all lenders of a resolution plan as per RBI’s framework.  Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 36.27 billion Rupees. There were recoveries and upgrades of 22.64 billion Rupees from the retail and business banking portfolio and 13.63 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The recoveries and upgrades in the corporate and SME portfolio during Q1 of 2022 mainly represent a few accounts which were upgraded post the implementation of a resolution plan as per RBI’s framework, by all lenders. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 15.89 billion Rupees. The Bank sold gross NPAs amounting to 2.40 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022 on a cash basis. The gross NPAs sold during the quarter were entirely from the corporate and SME portfolio.  The net non-performing assets were 93.06 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021 compared to 91.80 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021. The gross NPA ratio was 5.15% at June 30, 2021 compared to 4.96% at March 31, 2021. The net NPA ratio was 1.16% at June 30, 2021 compared to 1.14% at March 31, 2021. The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 11 of 38 classified as non-performing was 41.01 billion Rupees as of June 30, 2021 compared to 44.05 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 16.55 billion Rupees as of June 30, 2021 on this non-fund based outstanding.  The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers, under resolution as per various guidelines was 48.64 billion Rupees or about 0.7% of the total loan portfolio at June 30, 2021 compared to 39.27 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021. Of the total fund based outstanding at June 30, 2021, 21.80 billion Rupees was from the retail and business banking portfolio and 26.84 billion Rupees was from the corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 8.99 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is in excess of the requirement as per RBI guidelines.  The overdues across various portfolios increased in April and May due to the reasons which Sandeep highlighted earlier. With the easing of restrictions from June, collections and recoveries have improved and overdues have declined.  We had mentioned in our previous quarter’s earnings call, that overdues in the performing portfolio across retail EMI products and credit cards, SME and business banking portfolio were either marginally higher or at pre-Covid levels at March 31, 2021. The percentage of overdues in the performing portfolio across most of these segments at June-end was similar to or lower than December 2020 levels. Less than 1% of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was overdue at June-end. As Sandeep mentioned, we expect further improvement in collections and decline in overdues in the coming quarters.  C. P&L Details  Net interest income increased by 17.8% year-on-year to 109.36 billion Rupees. Interest on income tax refund was 0.14 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 0.11 billion Rupees in the previous quarter and 0.24 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year. The net interest margin was at 3.89% in Q1 of 2022 compared to 3.84% in the previous quarter and 3.69% in Q1 of last year. The impact of interest on income tax refund and interest collections from NPAs was about 2 basis points this quarter compared to about 4 basis points in the previous quarter and in Q1 of last year. The domestic NIM was at 3.99% this quarter compared to 3.94% in Q4 and 3.91% in Q1 last year. International margins were at 0.27%. The cost of deposits was 3.65% in Q1 compared to 3.80% in Q4.   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 12 of 38 Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 55.7% year-on-year to 37.06 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022 primarily due to base effect.   Fee income increased by 53.0% year-on-year to 32.19 billion Rupees in Q1. Fees from retail, business banking and SME customers grew by 65.4% year- on-year and constituted about 76% of the total fees in Q1 of 2022. Total fee income declined by 15.6% sequentially reflecting the decline in investment and borrowing activity by customers during the quarter.  Dividend income from subsidiaries was 4.10 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022 compared to 1.87 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year. Dividend income in Q1 of this year includes final dividend from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.  On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 29.9% year-on-year in Q1. The employee expenses increased by 9.6% year-on-year and by 18.2% sequentially. The Bank had slightly over 100,000 employees at June 30, 2021. Non-employee expenses increased by 47.7% year-on-year in Q1 of 2022 primarily due to base effect. The non- employee expenses declined by 8.3% sequentially due to lower business volumes during the quarter, partly offset by, technology related expenses.  The core operating profit increased by 22.7% year-on-year to 86.05 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022.  There was a treasury gain of 2.90 billion Rupees in Q1 compared to a loss of 0.25 billion Rupees in Q4 and a gain of 37.63 billion Rupees in Q1 of the previous year. Treasury gains in Q1 of previous year included gains of 30.36 billion Rupees from sale of stake in ICICI Life and ICICI General.  The total net provisions during the quarter were 28.52 billion Rupees. We have further strengthened our provisioning policies on NPAs during this quarter. The provisions during the quarter were higher by 11.27 billion Rupees due to this more conservative approach.  During the quarter, the Bank wrote back 10.50 billion Rupees of Covid-19 related provisions created in earlier periods. This was based on the updated position of various   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 13 of 38 portfolios underlying these provisions, after taking into account the NPAs already accounted for and specific provisions held against the same, as well as potential future credit losses arising out of the pandemic and its economic impact. The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 78.2% as of June 30, 2021. In addition, we continue to hold Covid-19 related provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees, which is about 0.9% of loans. We are confident that these provisions will completely cushion the balance sheet from the potential credit losses which may arise due to the pandemic. The performance of the portfolio and the strength of the balance sheet give us significant comfort.  The profit before tax grew by 89.8% year-on-year to 60.43 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022 compared to 31.83 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year. The tax expense was 14.27 billion Rupees in Q1 of 2022 compared to 5.84 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit after tax grew by 77.6% year-on-year to 46.16 billion Rupees in Q1 this year compared to 25.99 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year.  The consolidated profit after tax was 47.47 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 48.86 billion Rupees in Q4 and 31.18 billion Rupees in Q1 last year.  D. Capital  The CET1 ratio, including profits for Q1 of 2022 was 17.01% at June 30, 2021 compared to 16.80% at March 31, 2021. The Tier 1 ratio was 18.24% and the total capital adequacy ratio was 19.27% at June 30, 2021.  E. Portfolio information  We have been growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward. Our retail portfolio has been built based on proprietary data and analytics in addition to bureau checks, utilising the existing customer database for sourcing in key retail asset products through cross sell and up-sell and pricing in relation to the risk. Our strong deposit franchise enables us to offer competitive pricing to the selected customer segments. As Sandeep mentioned, disbursements across key retail products declined in April and May. However, these recovered in June and trends in July also appear   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 14 of 38 promising. We continuously monitor the performance at a sub-segment level and recalibrate the customer selection and underwriting norms in view of the current operating environment so as to leverage the demand while operating within our risk appetite. The Bank had calibrated its credit filters and underwriting norms following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. With the gradual unlock and subsequent recovery observed, some rollback of the measures were carried out. The Bank reviewed the same in view of the second wave of Covid-19 and considering the measures already place, no significant further action was deemed necessary. However, due to the evolving environment, policy rationalization measures are being continuously taken as per our analysis of various micro segments.  We have given further information on our retail and business banking portfolio in slides 34 to 45 of our investor presentation.  The loan and non-fund based outstanding to corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and below (excluding fund and non-fund based outstanding to NPAs) was 139.75 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021 compared to 130.98 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021, details of which are given on slide 37 of the investor presentation.

On slide 38 of the presentation, we have provided the movement in our BB and below portfolio during Q1 of 2022. The increase during the quarter primarily reflects a few accounts which were upgraded post the implementation of a resolution plan as per RBI’s framework.  Except for fund based outstanding of project under implementation accounts in the commercial real estate sector amounting to about 3 billion Rupees, all corporate and SME borrowers under resolution were rated below investment grade at June 30, 2021 The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans and working capital loans was 230.05 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021 or 3% of our total loan portfolio.

177	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  No, here the issue is not about LTV. I think like we mentioned given the current environment, the collections could not take place and typically as you know in the jewel loan portfolio, if the loan goes into overdue, you send auction notices to customers. In the current environment, we have not done that in the months of April and May and large part of June as well. So that is something that we have started now in the month of July and we have already started to see recoveries from these portfolios. From the LTV perspective, the LTV allowed by RBI was about 75%. RBI had increased that during the last year. We also had increased our LTV, but as I said that is not an issue. These loans are completely covered by the value of the gold in the collateral that we have.	774		2	 We also had increased our LTV, but as I said that is not an issue.

179	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Like I said Mahrukh earlier that if you look at the overall additions to the NPAs in the retail portfolio last year and you compare that with this year first quarter - last year as a whole I am taking because there were many issues like moratorium and Supreme Court judgment, the quarter numbers were varying a lot - if you look at it from an annual perspective, last year and Q1 this year, the trend on the retail side excluding rural, I would say home loan is actually pretty similar to what we had last year. We had seen higher   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 18 of 38 slippages, relatively speaking to last year, on the commercial vehicle portfolio and on the unsecured side actually, that is personal loan and credit card, it has been somewhat better than last year. That is what we have seen in the first quarter and again the overall numbers have to be seen in the context that unlike last year we did not have any of the regulatory dispensation this year, so we were expecting to see the impact of the second wave in a more upfront manner during the current financial year and that is what we have seen. From here on, we should see a decline in the pace of addition to NPA. Of course, they will still be somewhat elevated in the coming quarter, but again taking out any assumption on the third wave, we are not kind of factoring that in, if we keep that aside for a moment, into the second half of the year, definitely we should start seeing meaningful reduction in the addition to NPLs and of course to some extent the current environment has also impacted collections and the recoveries which happened from the NPL portfolio. But despite that, if you look at it, from the retail portfolio itself, we have recovered about Rs. 22 billion in the current quarter compared to additions of about Rs. 68 billion, so about one third of that has been the recovery level from the retail portfolio.	1905		2	 68 billion, so about one third of that has been the recovery level from the retail portfolio.  22 billion in the current quarter compared to additions of about Rs.

185	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  I think there could be a couple of portfolios where we would have tightened in December and we have done further tightening this quarter as well. Mahrukh, the way we look at it is purely from a point of view that we have made it more conservative. We are very conscious about the coverage ratio that we want to maintain on the portfolio. And when the NPA additions are higher like we had in this quarter on a gross basis and on a net basis, we would have increased some provision on the early buckets of NPAs. Again, I don’t think it reflects anything in terms of our expectation of eventual recovery from these NPL categories in which we have increased the provisions. There could of course be some delay in recoveries. For example, the level of recoveries that we were expecting in this quarter sitting in February versus what it turned out to be was definitely lower than what we had thought. So, there could be some delay in recoveries which could happen. But otherwise, it is just ensuring that our balance sheet remains strong in terms of the net NPLs and in terms of the coverage ratio. If you look at our net NPAs through the Covid-19 period starting from March 2020, the net NPAs actually came down in the last 5 quarters compared to March 2020. If you look at the net NPA outstanding, compared to March 2021 in June 2021 again, it is like a marginal increase. So we have looked at all of these aspects as well.	1422		0	 We are very conscious about the coverage ratio that we want to maintain on the portfolio.  For example, the level of recoveries that we were expecting in this quarter sitting in February versus what it turned out to be was definitely lower than what we had thought.  If you look at the net NPA outstanding, compared to March 2021 in June 2021 again, it is like a marginal increase.  There could of course be some delay in recoveries. I think there could be a couple of portfolios where we would have tightened in December and we have done further tightening this quarter as well.	acquisitions coverage decline increase underperformed debt there fall grow clear invest stabilizing overvalued recovered undervalued uncertain falling lower good said comments correct rise yes adjustments progress down unclear positive declined stabilized over	estimates acquisitions coverage decline increase underperformed debt increased there wrong fall concerned grow changed clear strong negative invest tightened overvalued undervalued money reported improving liquidity continue recover falling figures calculations mixed good benefit said comments different tighten right correct rise yes adjustments intact progress contribute bearish down not unclear positive declined over

There were some opportunities for the Bank to deploy some of the surplus liquidity in the form of FX swaps, so, that is something that we had done. It was just a change in the form of liquidity that we maintained and that shows up in the other interest income as swap income instead of interest income on investments or some other category, as would have happened in the normal course of time. There is no one-off there. Moderator:  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nilanjan Karfa from Nomura.

188	\icici\june-21.pdf	Nilanjan Karfa 	  Just want to dwell on that last question on the higher recoveries in the retail and business banking portfolio, obviously in the last year we had pretty high slippages, I think between fiscal 2020 and 2021, the retail slippages had more than doubled, so I find it quite curious that while it was challenging in collections this quarter, we had slippages and we also had collections, so would you elaborate what kind of slippages actually we had seen last year because I am guessing that all of the collections which had happened in this quarter were from the last year slippages and therefore colour of the recoveries that had actually happened in this quarter, so that is my first question.	693		2	.	behind complete confidential increase neutral answered below reported private statement changed correct ticker figures release orders show	behind complete increase neutral answered changed clear here ticker removed release confidential reported statement figures orders good recoveries said right collections correct yes progress contribute below comment declined history over
189	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Nilanjan, again just to say, if you look at the last year, bulk of the NPL additions happened in the March quarter.  If you look at the slide 31 of the investor presentation, out of Rs. 128 billion of the gross NPA additions in FY2021, close to Rs. 100 billion was in Q4-2021 on an actual basis, not on proforma basis. The stock of NPLs did go up quite substantially in the last financial year and as I said we were expecting recoveries to be pretty high this year and for Q1 sitting in February or early March we would have thought of an even higher number than what we eventually had in the quarter. The collections, for example, in the first couple of weeks of April was still relatively okay. June as we mentioned, things started to get better specially from the second week onwards and again the benefit of   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 21 of 38 the retail portfolio is that it is a very granular portfolio. These are home loans, car loans, personal loans, credit cards. So, there will always be additions and deletions that will happen in this portfolio. Again, I don’t want to put out a number on this, but if things remain, the third wave is not at all as intense as what we saw in the second wave and it is much milder, then we would definitely expect to see better recoveries in the second half of the year as well.	1335		2	 The stock of NPLs did go up quite substantially in the last financial year and as I said we were expecting recoveries to be pretty high this year and for Q1 sitting in February or early March we would have thought of an even higher number than what we eventually had in the quarter.

190	\icici\june-21.pdf	Nilanjan Karfa 	  May be I will need a little more color, but to cut to the chase, given that we are saying that second half, I think the Q2 itself, I think you are calling out to be slightly better in terms of lower additions, let us keep aside third wave for a while and you are saying the second half will be a lot better in terms of additions and collections equally, would you want to call out that gross additions will be lower than last year?

191	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  On the gross additions, it is difficult to say. The fact is that in the first quarter, the additions on a gross basis were Rs. 72 billion. Will the additions fall off as sharply or remain at the same levels as last year, that looks difficult. But again the way we look at it and specially on the retail portfolio is that we have to take into consideration the deletions and recoveries that happen as well. In the retail portfolio you will see additions and deletions all the while. So even if the gross additions were to be higher than last year, I think if you look at the recovery number, that would also be meaningfully higher than last year. So, we expect some improvement in the September quarter and then meaningful improvement into the second half of the year. It is difficult to hazard any specific number on that and again all of this is also subject to how the pandemic plays out from here and there are so many other factors as well. This is the best estimate that we can have right now.	1000		0	 It is difficult to hazard any specific number on that and again all of this is also subject to how the pandemic plays out from here and there are so many other factors as well.

192	\icici\june-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Rakesh, I thought I will just give a colour on the consumer behaviour because I think there is an angle of consumer behaviour here. We had seen last time also that the   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 22 of 38 moment there is uncertainty and there is a bit of anxiety, generally, the trend is to hoard cash and get into emergency funds. So, emergency fund this time around also we saw that there was a shift and obviously the bounces and the overdue position worsened in April and May. This is on the asset side. We also saw on the liability side, people taking out cash from ATMs and keeping it at home, so we also saw withdrawal and you will see across the banking system in general that the retail FD growth rates have been lower this quarter. Actually, we have to see this liability and asset movement with the consumer behaviour and in the first two months and first fortnight of June also, the anxiety hasn’t fully gone, it is in the second fortnight of June that some bit of confidence started to come back and once the confidence started to come back, there is an unwind of the emergency funds that people want to keep. Emergency funds, they keep by way of delaying repayments and also if they have got balances in their liabilities account, keeping it in cash because this time around for hospitalization and buying of medicines, etc., actual cash was required. We saw that consumer behaviour as well, which is why you will see that in upgrades etc., it will also move a bit with the sentiment, which is why we saw higher upgrades in Q1, bulk of it also came in June. April and May bounce rates and overdues had worsened, in June it had improved substantially, July also the trends are better. I thought I will just overlay the consumer behaviour and what a consumer is thinking and its impact on the asset side as well as on the liability side.	1861		0	Rakesh, I thought I will just give a colour on the consumer behaviour because I think there is an angle of consumer behaviour here.

194	\icici\june-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  No, actually a very good question, so we have to look at it product by product., So in jewel loans for example, because the customer’s jewelry is there with us as collateral, people walk in and pay most of it, we don’t go out and collect. So that got impacted more in the first quarter and then, of course the issue of auction was there. On the others, most of our collections, 90% plus, now we are collecting digitally. We are not sort of sending people and doing all of it. We are collecting digitally and over a period of time for us, most of our collections are through digital modes and this has been increasing   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 23 of 38 over a period of time. For non-account holders there are auto debits through NACH. Bulk of it is all digital collection, so our dependence on actually people going out and collecting does get impacted, to some extent, I will not say it doesn’t, but our dependence on that, let us say, compared to one or two years back, is now much lesser. So, to that extent, we are okay. We are more driven by the consumer behaviour and the anxiety levels in the market, so if we were to sort of plot an anxiety meter versus movement on the overdue as well as on the liability side, you will see that they are fairly co-related. So I would say that is a much bigger driver than sending people and collecting. Our dependence is much less and we would continue to make it less and less dependent on that. Moderator:  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Suresh Ganapathy from Macquarie. Please go ahead.	1564		1	 Our dependence is much less and we would continue to make it less and less dependent on that.

What exactly is the recovery that you are seeing there? Second question is to both Anup and Sandeep, first beginning with the impact of Mastercard, have you guys assessed that? And the other aspect is, with these fintechs coming in and you guys also have partnership with them, what is the value that you see in them bringing to you, what is it that you guys can't do that fintech guys are doing it better, be it technology or be it customer segment, any color on that would be very helpful.	849		1	Just two questions, rather three quick questions.

196	\icici\june-21.pdf	Vishakha Mulye 	  Suresh, on the corporate side, two things, the capital expenditure and the working capital. So let us take Q1 out because of the pandemic wave 2, clearly in April and May, one did see some impact on the capacity utilizations and stuff like that. But if you look at generally on the corporate side, the capacity utilizations have gone up, the commodity cycles are at the peak and therefore general requirement of working capital has gone up   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 24 of 38 and we have seen an improvement in the utilization on the working capital side. Having said that, many of these corporates have actually gone and raised capital either in the form of equity because of buoyant equity market or they have relied on raising money in the form of bonds in the market to fund those working capital needs. Going forward, I expect this momentum to continue, the way one had seen in the last year. Coming to capital expenditure, I would divide it into two parts, first the private corporates and then the public sector. As far as the private sector is concerned, one must admit that one has not seen much capital expenditure in terms of large projects and so on and so forth. Of course, people have taken opportunities in the last two years to balance their capacities and do a normal capital expenditure or I would say a slightly more than the normal capital expenditure in the last nine months or one year, but really not anything to expand the capacity because typically the corporate would look at expanding the capacities and they see their existing capacity getting sweated on a consistent basis or a sustainable basis. So that kind of capital expenditure demand I must admit has not been seen from the private sector. As far as public sector is concerned, I think they continue to grow, they have their capital expenditure plans and we have seen robust growth and as we have said in our remarks, we have focused therefore on the large corporates, well rated corporates and the PSUs and you see a growth of almost 15% year-on-year in our performing domestic corporate book, excluding the builder portfolio.	2125		2	 As far as the private sector is concerned, one must admit that one has not seen much capital expenditure in terms of large projects and so on and so forth.

197	\icici\june-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Let me take the second part of the question, so one is on the Mastercard impact. The Mastercard impact on us is virtually negligible because for all the variants of Mastercard, we also have Visa, so we have shifted over to Visa and Mastercard is very little. Actually, it is in a few thousands per month and our flagship which is the Amazon card runs on Visa, so to that extent large part of the credit cards is also protected. The second question is very interesting which is the fintech and what is it that we get and what banks cannot do. I would say honestly that there is nothing technically which a fintech does that a bank cannot do. So, what are the positives there and what are the negatives and what are the learnings for banks. For banks like us, I think first there is a gap on the speed of imagining the solution. Fintechs, because they are very focused on a problem that they are solving for the customer, generally they are the first on the block to solve that problem. Banks like us look at large breadth and depth of customers and have many problems to solve,   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 25 of 38 so sometimes in prioritization, some fintechs, not all, are very focused on that customer segment and they move up the block first. What banks have to do is, we need to have our tentacles far and wide which we have, to see which problems are getting solved and are those problems relevant for our customer segments as well. If they are relevant to our customer segment, we have two choices, either we build the solution on our own or we partner. Generally, our approach is to partner because the fintechs are focused on that solution, they have done that solution and we have a much larger customer base to give and we can scale that up fast. Fintechs, we have seen, they solve the problem correctly, but most of them find it difficult to scale up, some of course scale up very well. So that is one thing. Second is that, how fast can a bank do it, because fintechs are very focused on a particular segment since they don’t have the complexity of a bank. At times, they can be faster in solutions and they could be more flexible and agile, but in the fast and agile, we have seen in our experience, they find it difficult to make adjustments. They are not able to move into the adjacencies that easily which is that they focus on one customer segment, one problem and that is it and they are not able to move with us. And on the customer side if we see, a customer requires a full solution, so if a problem requires 10 solutions, if somebody is giving only four solutions, generally the adoption is not that good. From a bank’s perspective we give four plus we add six, so that we are able to give 10, hence the customer’s stickiness with us increases. We have seen it for example, in iMobile Pay, as Sandeep had also mentioned earlier, that within six months these are non-ICICI Bank customers, it is all in the pool and customers are taking it up on their own, so we are seeing almost 4 lakhs non-ICICI Bank customers per month coming in and it is accelerating. So, we look very closely on product and ecosystem and then our customer segment fit and that is what we are continuously looking and we partner with many fintechs. We of course do our own stuff as well, but we partner a lot of fintechs and we create our own solutions for that. From a banking perspective, the big advantage that we have which many fintechs may not have is, our ability to do KYC which is Know Your Customer and know their context which is much better than any fintech in a broader sense. In a narrow sense, sometimes banks miss on prioritization, but if we keep our tentacles on, then we don’t miss on opportunities, then we become fast followers, we pick it up and we move fast. So, I would say that this game of fintech versus bank, one is certainly of partnership, second, our ability to also cross- sell other products to the same customer in banking system is higher than any of the fintechs. Fintechs are narrow in their definition of the problem and customer and solution   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 26 of 38 and as I said earlier, to move across other products. They build brand in a very narrow way, but bank branding is wider, so customers also expect that they can take a mortgage also from us and buy mutual funds from us and buy protection from us and give liabilities to us. It is a brand building exercise which is difficult, it takes some time to build that kind of broader appeal to the customer. So I feel that at this point of time, anybody who is agile and has tentacles open and is very focused on problem solving for the customers, will do reasonably well and that is what we are attempting to do and learn at all points of time and we see the product ecosystem fit and the customer segment fit and we keep on seeing the fit. There are many initiatives and many solutions we come out with, it doesn’t move that fast, so we will let it be, we test and learn and get that feedback. The high frequency touch with us, with the bank is generally higher and so with the digital footprint, we are also able to use them at other places like underwriting, getting the context of the customer, helping them cross-sell, so overall I feel that if banks are agile, if banks are alert, if banks have their tentacles spread out, we do have a very good chance of winning this market for sure. So, I would say that is one. Of course, on the banking side, we are a regulated entity, many other fintechs are not regulated entities. To that extent, there is some short-term agility or flexibility that they will have, but as they grow up, there will be clamour for regulations to come in and regulations, they are sometimes good because they increase trust in the system, but sometimes they also open up some small arbitrages which makes them more flexible for some time at least, so that is the positive. So basically the game is evenly spread and banks have natural advantages and it is for incumbents like us to actually win this market and serve the customers well across their needs, across their spectrum in a broad way and in a deep way.	6163		1	 The high frequency touch with us, with the bank is generally higher and so with the digital footprint, we are also able to use them at other places like underwriting, getting the context of the customer, helping them cross-sell, so overall I feel that if banks are agile, if banks are alert, if banks have their tentacles spread out, we do have a very good chance of winning this market for sure.

200	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Rakesh here, I will just take that question. In terms of the disclosure, it is of the cases where the resolution has been implemented. So that is the reason why that number has gone up. If you look at our disclosure that we have put out on slide 32, that gives the total fund based outstanding under various resolution frameworks which was about Rs. 48 billion, excluding the NPAs, compared to about Rs. 39 billion at March 31, 2021. Of the Rs. 48 billion of fund based outstanding at June-end, Rs. 22 billion is retail and about Rs. 26 billion is corporate. It is the same set, nothing incremental which has happened on the corporate side during the quarter in terms of restructuring. There were a few accounts which were NPA as of March-end where resolution got implemented in Q1 and those cases got upgraded. When we explained the increase in corporate and SME BB portfolio, we said that some of the NPAs where restructuring was not implemented by March 31, it got implemented by June 30 and have been upgraded to standard. Those cases show up in this table as well and also in our BB portfolio.	1100		2	 48 billion, excluding the NPAs, compared to about Rs. Rakesh here, I will just take that question.

Personal loans and credit cards are better than last year as per the trends that we have seen in the June quarter on the retail additions other than rural part.	439		2	We don’t give a product-wise kind of breakup.

204	\icici\june-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Abhishek the loan tenure itself is short for retail loan except for mortgage which are longer loan tenure. Just to add to Rakesh's point, on the mortgage side, it was similar to last year and is a very large book for us. If you remember the moratorium on the mortgage book last year of the largest mortgage lender was substantially higher. The reason is because they are low cost and there are large EMIs and there is no prepayment cost. So, you know it is a very good case, if somebody wants emergency fund, I would much rather shift that payment a little bit than others, let us say, personal loan and credit card and other things which are more expensive. I am saying logically if a client is behaving logically, which normally they do, that would be the general behaviour of a client.	790		1	Abhishek the loan tenure itself is short for retail loan except for mortgage which are longer loan tenure.

208	\icici\june-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  No, in general, Mahesh, even in 2008, we didn’t lose on the mortgage side. One, our LTVs are well controlled and number two, many of them, most of them in fact are either where customers are staying there, so it is an SORP, the self-occupied residential property or the source of income and customers would not want it to get mortgaged and sold. So essentially that is the situation actually on the mortgage side. So, there are no losses as such which have come in mortgage. Actually, we don’t have to sell. In mortgages, the fact is that even in 2008, we didn’t have to sell that much actually to recover and even when we had sold, again it is all past, because we will have to see if we have to sell what happens, there is no great loss or anything like that. Credit costs are very low plus our provision coverage ratio is very good. Actually, I would say that for a mortgage kind of business, this kind of provision coverage ratio certainly will do better with high probability and high confidence of course in the future.	1027		1	 In mortgages, the fact is that even in 2008, we didn’t have to sell that much actually to recover and even when we had sold, again it is all past, because we will have to see if we have to sell what happens, there is no great loss or anything like that.

212	\icici\june-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Basically, the stand we have is not to take the collateral and sell and recover, that is not the first choice we have. Our first choice always is that customer should keep the collateral and they should pay us back and generally we have seen that is how it happens. So, there are cases, where we assess whether it is a complete loss of income or it is a temporary loss of income. If it is a complete loss of income and customer says that there is no way in which I can pay you and here is the collateral, you know I am willing to give them, then we will take that action, but that is not the preferred route for us. We have seen that in most cases, in fact in majority of the cases it is circumstantial and not intention to default. It is circumstantial and with the event flow it happens and people do pay back and we don’t have to seize the collateral. In any case, economically also seizing a collateral and selling is a more involved process. If it is a vehicle, then it depreciates, if it is a real estate now, sale is low, commercial real estate sale will be slow, etc., so that is not our preferred mode of recovery. Our preferred mode is that customer should pay back. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manish Ostwal from Nirmal Bang. Please go ahead.

214	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 We would reassess the Covid-19 related provision that we hold on a quarter-on-quarter basis depending on the status of the pandemic. For example, in December quarter itself, we had utilized about Rs. 18 billion from this Covid-19 provision and till February we were actually, definitely thinking of or planning to utilize more in the March quarter. That changed post the second wave coming in towards the end of March and we actually made a further Rs. 10 billion of provision in Q4-2021. This quarter, we have re-assessed the Covid-19 provision and based on the portfolio trends, the NPA slippages that we have seen from the portfolio, the provisions that we hold there plus the expectations for the rest of the year, we believe that the provision that we are holding currently of about Rs. 64 billion or so is more than adequate. That is an assessment that we will have to do on an ongoing basis.	899		1	 This quarter, we have re-assessed the Covid-19 provision and based on the portfolio trends, the NPA slippages that we have seen from the portfolio, the provisions that we hold there plus the expectations for the rest of the year, we believe that the provision that we are holding currently of about Rs.

So aside from that hopefully, in the second half of the year, one should see provisions coming off, but it is very difficult to say. Our approach is that at all points of time, maintain a balance sheet which is strong in terms of coverage ratio and net NPA levels. So that is something   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 32 of 38 that we will continue to factor in.

218	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 On the margins, I think like we have been saying, our approach is to kind of see what best we can do. I think the most important part of the margin is the deposit franchise and the cost of funds and cost of deposits that we have. We have seen that decline in the June quarter as well, the decline in cost of deposit is about 15 basis points. I think the cost of deposits is now coming down to a bottom because incrementally the deposit rates have not come down for a while. So it will bottom out soon. Yields have been very competitive. I think across retail and corporate, the business teams have been very conscious about the tradeoff which is there between growth, margin and profitability and of course the risk part of it is well. Especially on the corporate side, we have looked at the growth in a manner which is supportive of margins and operating profit, so that is something that we will continue to do. This quarter, I guess some of the liquidity did come off for us and that would have helped a bit. We also got some bit of higher yield on the surplus liquidity as I mentioned earlier in response to Mahrukh’s query that we had put some of our liquidity through FX swaps where the yield was a bit higher. But those are not very significant numbers in the overall context. I think the risk to margin will continue to be from competitive pricing and secondly, in our balance sheet now we have fair bit of market benchmark linked loans. If we see any change in our funding cost or deposit rate without commensurate change in repo rate by RBI, that could be a risk factor as well.

220	\icici\june-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 If you look at the business banking and the SME portfolio, we have described how that portfolio has been constructed. In the business banking portfolio, the ticket size is pretty low and it is pretty well collateralized. In the last year through the moratorium and after that also the trends were quite stable and continue to remain the same. The overdue levels in that portfolio are pretty much the same as we have had in the past. So, we are quite comfortable on that. SME is slightly larger ticket size than the business banking portfolio, the collateral levels are not at the 100% level that we have in business banking. So, to some extent, SME does have a bit of higher risks than business banking. But again in terms of the numbers that we are seeing till now, there is nothing that we are finding which would be of big worry. There has been some increase in the overdue book in the June quarter compared to where we were in the March quarter, but that was expected and there are lot of them in the early bucket and we would expect that to resolve also. So, we are quite comfortable on this book as we are seeing it currently. Moderator: Thank you. We take the last question from the line of Jai Mundra from B&K Securities.

222	\icici\june-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  I will just expand your question a little bit. See there are three kinds of large flows that are happening. There is a large corporate ecosystem where the flow happens, dealer- vendor, their own working capital that flow happens. Second one is the flow that happens on our business banking, SME and our trade customers who may have taken credit, may not have taken credit, but both of them are essentially B2B type. Now, you have this merchant, which is the B2C, when I am saying C it is the last leg, is essentially with consumers and there is a payment leg involved, so you will see that most of the solution on the merchant side essentially happens on the payment side. So, with the payment, first the flow happens to you, so that is one movement that happens. So, there is a large consumption basket which moves from savings account to current account or reduction in OD, etc., essentially to the business side every month and that is where the flow is. We have a decent market share there, so it is not right to assume that we have low market share, we have decent market share, but the other players were stronger than us for sure in this place. One big opportunity that is now coming is that there is a divergence because the number of payment modes have increased, number one and number two, if you look at the consumer behaviour that we are seeing, we are seeing scan to pay, pay to contact, UPI payment, etc., those are also expanding, so P2M transactions are expanding and as Sandeep talked about it in the opening remarks how our P2M is moving and sequentially it is jumping. The other thing that we can do the new merchant STACK that we have come out with and the super current account, we are giving instant settlement. Our instant settlement is something which is of great value to the customer and the reason why we are able to give instant settlement also is because the whole ecosystem belongs to us, both on the saving side as well as on the current account and the merchant side. So that is the one way of capturing this because there are new modes of payment which is happening that opens up newer ways of capturing that opportunity. The second one of course is that to aggregators, one captures that opportunity and you tie up with aggregators and there you partner with aggregators and then you capture this. Third of course is the traditional POS method. We think that from a POS perspective, they will be with very large retailers. As you go smaller and smaller, things will move towards scan and pay and other more contactless methods and that is where one big opportunity is there. From our perspective, that is the way we will be sort of thinking through this thing and making sure that the smaller   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 35 of 38 merchants have a very strong proposition why they should deal with ICICI Bank, we will partner, we will create our own solutions and we will make them more efficient and effective and we will have more digital footprint, we will be able to lend them, so essentially everything we will be able to do as against some other players who might just be helping them with payment or some other players who will be helping just with lending and at this point of time, banks will be slightly better placed on lending, if one has digital footprint and underwriting methods because we have more data about our own clients. At this point of time, it is moving at a fast pace I think it is a very interesting area and an evolving area and not fully solved for. So that is the problem that we are trying to solve for and we think that there is a good play there.	3624		1	 At this point of time, it is moving at a fast pace I think it is a very interesting area and an evolving area and not fully solved for.  Third of course is the traditional POS method.  So, with the payment, first the flow happens to you, so that is one movement that happens. , Our instant settlement is something which is of great value to the customer and the reason why we are able to give instant settlement also is because the whole ecosystem belongs to us, both on the saving side as well as on the current account and the merchant side. I will just expand your question a little bit.  See there are three kinds of large flows that are happening.  One big opportunity that is now coming is that there is a divergence because the number of payment modes have increased, number one and number two, if you look at the consumer behaviour that we are seeing, we are seeing scan to pay, pay to contact, UPI payment, etc.	behind acquisitions complete increase neutral answered happened there purchases fall grow changed clear invest here ticker removed release website confidential money reported statement today falling figures coming orders fail changing good benefit saying said comments different data now payments right revenue correct yes history progress contribute below expanding not changes unclear positive payment happening over	acquisitions over participate drop increase underperformed happened there purchases fall mistake changed done negative strong here reference clear invest grow remarks pay website confidential loans sense money statement moving say today expanded falling figures coming grown changing opportunities good benefit saying credit said comments different data now payments right correct rise yes inflation progress that growing struggled contribute comment lending expanding announced not unclear positive payment history launched doing

224	\icici\june-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Merchant base, just to give you some sense, there is no sort of direct data available, but we would think that there will be close to 20 million merchants of all shapes and sizes, small, big, very large, etc., of which may be 8-10 million would be of a reasonably size, however there is no clear estimate available. We are sampling and I am just giving you a data, it may be of 2% here and there, but there is no real data available, but I think that would be the size. Our also estimate again, take it with a pinch of salt, because there is no such data available. The monthly movement from savings account on the consumption per month ranges between 2-2.5 trillion per month, so that is the kind of movement that happens on the savings account to the merchant account every month across all payment modes. So, this is across all payment modes. We might not have captured some, but that is our best estimate. We don’t know, this estimate could be higher, certainly not lower, but it may be slightly delta high. So that is the kind of money movement that is happening. But as you know payments in itself is not a profitable business. Payments generate a profit pool in terms of data which can then be used for underwriting, cross selling other products. We are in a unique position because we have deposit float and with that float we make some money which other players in the market may not be able to do as they don’t have a similar type of liability franchise. So I thought I will just give you some sense, may be 20 million merchants in total. Of it, 8-10 million   ICICI Bank Ltd July 24, 2021   Page 36 of 38 could be some estimate. Don’t hold me to estimate because these are the estimates from our own sampling. This will give you some sense and certainly two trillion plus movement on consumption from savings account to merchant accounts per month across all payment modes. I am just trying to estimate the size of the market for that.	1948		1	 The monthly movement from savings account on the consumption per month ranges between 2-2.

It is not something which should happen anytime soon, but when the tightening happens the market rates could go up before the repo rate at points of time specially on the wholesale deposit side. That is the risk of mismatch because on the liability side, like you rightly said, that is all fixed rate deposits or CASA deposits. There are no floating rate liabilities which are there. So we will have to manage that as and when that plays out. As I said over a period it should average out, but there could be a lag in that.	733		1	 It is not something which should happen anytime soon, but when the tightening happens the market rates could go up before the repo rate at points of time specially on the wholesale deposit side.

In terms of the business opportunity for both the business banking and SME segment, we believe there is huge opportunity. Our own market share in this segment in the past has been somewhat lower than the share that we have in other businesses.  We have been taking a lot of initiatives on the technology and digital side and Anup talked about many of them. I think these initiatives are really enabling us to grow not just on the lending business, but also on the current account and FX and transaction banking side. So it is a portfolio in which we believe there is lot of opportunity.

Going forward, I think like we mentioned that we will see some restructuring happening in the Covid 2.0 framework on the retail. For example, it could be for some of the existing NPAs or for new loans. So in the September quarter we will see some increase on account of that.

I      Page 2 of 23 now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Bakhshi -- Managing Director and CEO of ICICI Bank. Thank you and over to you, sir. Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks  Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the results for Q1 of FY2023. Joining us today on this call are Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh, Anindya and Abhinek. During the quarter, we saw continued improvement in parameters like the index of industrial production, travel and mobility, pickup in non-oil and non-gold imports and bank credit. There are concerns arising out of the movements in inflation and interest and exchange rates, largely reflecting the uncertainties in the global environment. The Government and the Reserve Bank of India have taken various steps in this regard. We will continue to monitor these developments closely. At ICICI Bank, we aim to grow the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through a 360-degree customer-centric approach and by focusing on ecosystems and micro- markets. We continue to operate within our strategic framework and strengthen our franchise, enhance our delivery and servicing capabilities and expand our technology and digital offerings. Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:  First- Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the focused pursuit of target market segments The core operating profit increased by 19.4% year-on-year to 102.73 billion Rupees in this quarter. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries and associates, core operating profit grew by 21.1% year-on-year. The profit after tax grew by 49.6% year-on-year to 69.05 billion Rupees in this quarter. Second-Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise Total period-end deposits grew by 13.4% year-on-year at June 30, 2022. During the quarter, average current account deposits increased by 23.0% year-on-year and 2.9% sequentially. Average savings account deposits grew by 19.1% year-on-year and 4.4%      Page 3 of 23 sequentially. Period-end term deposits grew by 11.4% year-on-year at June 30, 2022. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was about 127%, reflecting continued surplus liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system. Third-Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward  The retail loan portfolio grew by 24.4% year-on-year and 5.1% sequentially at June 30, 2022. Including non-fund based outstanding, the retail portfolio was 44.0% of the total portfolio. The rural portfolio grew by 8.4% year-on-year and was flat sequentially. The business banking portfolio grew by 44.7% year-on-year and 7.4% sequentially. The SME portfolio grew by 32.3% year-on-year and declined by 2.6% sequentially. The growth in SME and business banking portfolios was driven by leveraging our branch network, cross sell to existing current account customers and digital offerings such as InstaBIZ and Merchant Stack. The domestic corporate portfolio grew by 14.4% year-on-year and 4.4% sequentially at June 30, 2022. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 21.7% year-on-year and 3.9% sequentially. The overall loan portfolio grew by 21.3% year-on-year and 4.3% sequentially at June 30, 2022. Fourth-Leveraging digital across our business We continue to enhance our digital offerings and platforms to onboard new customers in a seamless manner and provide them end-to-end digital journeys and personalised solutions. These platforms also enable us to do more data driven cross sell and up sell. Recently, we have further enhanced the open architecture based features of InstaBIZ. Merchants can now open a current account instantly and digitally on InstaBIZ by using video KYC. Through ‘InstaOD Plus’, customers of any bank can avail an overdraft facility of up to 2.5 million Rupees instantly on InstaBIZ. We have seen about 120,000 registrations from non-ICICI Bank account holders on InstaBIZ till June 30, 2022. Recently, the Bank launched a revamped OneSCF, an integrated supply chain platform providing corporate customers, their vendors and dealers with a one-stop solution to efficiently manage their working capital requirements. We have shared some details on our technology and digital offerings in slides 18 to 28 of the investor presentation.        Page 4 of 23 Fifth - Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks The net NPA ratio declined to 0.70% at June 30, 2022 from 0.76% at March 31, 2022 and 1.16% at June 30, 2021. During the quarter, there were net additions of 3.82 billion Rupees to gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale. The provisioning coverage ratio on NPAs was 79.6% at June 30, 2022. The total provisions during the quarter were 11.44 billion Rupees or 11.1% of core operating profit and 0.53% of average advances. This includes contingency provision of 10.50 billion Rupees made on a prudent basis. The Bank holds contingency provisions of 85.00 billion Rupees or about 0.9% of total loans as of June 30, 2022. Sixth- Maintaining a strong capital base The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.23%, Tier 1 ratio of 17.95% and total capital adequacy ratio of 18.74% at June 30, 2022, including profits for the quarter. Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to grow the core operating profit in a risk- calibrated manner. In order to leverage these opportunities, we have reorganized our business teams. Cities with large concentrated market opportunities have been organised under ‘city business heads’ covering the full spectrum of ecosystems. We have also focused on strengthening the workforce by skilling and providing cross-functional opportunities. We will continue to make investments in technology, people, distribution and building our brand. Going forward, we will continue to operate within our strategic framework while focusing on micro markets and ecosystems. The principles of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank” and “One Bank, One RoE” will guide our operations. We focus on building a culture where every employee in the Bank serves customers with humility and upholds the values of brand ICICI. We aim to be the trusted financial services provider of choice for our customers and deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders.

I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.      Page 5 of 23 A. Balance sheet growth  Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Coming to the growth across retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 22.3% year-on-year and 4.1% sequentially.

We continue to see increasing adoption and usage of our digital platforms from our customers. There have been 7.3 million activations of iMobile Pay by non-ICICI Bank account holders as of end-June. The value of transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders increased by 35% sequentially in the current quarter. The value of credit card spends in the current quarter grew by 12.6% sequentially and was two times the value of spends in Q1 of last year driven by improvement in discretionary spending, higher activation rate through digital onboarding of customers, including Amazon Pay credit cards, and diversification through commercial cards.

The loan and non-fund based outstanding to performing corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and below was 82.09 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022 compared to 108.08 billion Rupees at March 31, 2022. The amount of 82.09 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022 includes 22.89 billion Rupees of loans under resolution. The sequential decline during the quarter was mainly due to reduction in exposure to a borrower in the telecom sector and upgrades of a few accounts in power and construction sectors.

Other than one account in the power sector, where resolution has been implemented as per RBI’s Covid-19 resolution framework, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022.

So, it reflects the rates at which lending has been done over the last few quarters and the relative maturity versus new lending in the book because rates were quite competitive well into May as well. If you recall, last time we had mentioned that there is some arithmetical impact between Q4 and Q1 because of the number of days.

We had made a lot of changes in the way we approach this category of customers over the last 5 years in terms of distribution, our credit underwriting, our portfolio granularity and so on. This is probably one of the portfolios where the credit outcome so far post COVID has been somewhat better than what we may have originally anticipated. So, we are quite comfortable with growth in this portfolio. One of the other things that we have done over the last 3 years is invested heavily in digital propositions for this segment of customers. We have also seen a fairly high increase in digital adoption in this segment. Those are the areas that have driven this growth. It is a mix of working capital and sort of term loans. I don't think that there is anything specific to call out in terms of increase in working capital requirement in this quarter as such because the growth rates have been quite in line with what we have seen in the past adjusted for the period of dislocation during the pandemic.	1118		2	 Those are the areas that have driven this growth.

255	\icici\june-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 No, I don't think so. If you look at the improvement in profitability for what is reported in the corporate segment, I think part of that is due to actually a write-back of provisions as      Page 15 of 23 we continue to get recoveries out of past NPLs in that portfolio. On the retail side, of course, if you look at it on a year-on-year basis, there is a sort of multiple jump in the profit. For the sequential decline, I think 75%-80% of our cost base sits in retail. So, the sequential increase in costs that we discussed earlier in response to another question would largely reflect in retail. Also, as we mentioned in the first quarter, we do see the seasonally higher addition to NPLs in the KCC portfolio, which was Rs. 7.55 billion in this quarter, and the provisioning on that would also form part of the segmental result. But I don't think in terms of long-term profitability trend, there is anything to call out. The last thing I would like to say is that we are increasingly trying to organize ourselves around ecosystems. So, there is a lot of sort of how should I say it, for the regulatory requirements we would be reporting a segmental basis, but the way we are organized internally is much more around cross- functional teams and looking at particular customer ecosystems where these distinctions are quite blurred in that sense.

268	\icici\june-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 So, Jai, as we have been saying for some time, I think in the granular portfolios like retail, business banking, SME and so on, we need to focus on the net slippage. Similarly in the granular working capital accounts where there may be an NPL classification due to some technical reason, which then gets regularized. These types of accounts, to a large extent, tend to cure in a pretty short period of time. This is very different from the lumpy corporate- type exposure, which once they get into the NPA bucket, there is typically a long delay until the recovery happens. So, we would really focus on the net number. And as far as the net number is concerned, we have been saying for some time that -- of course, in the second half of last year, we had net deletions to gross NPA. So that was due to higher recoveries out of the stock of NPAs that had got created during the pandemic period. And we were expecting that we would start seeing net addition from the current quarter, which is what has played out. Although I must say that even the current level of net additions is relatively low. Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Nitin Aggarwal from Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead.

Any thoughts around this? Second question is on unsecured book. The PL and credit cards both are doing very well and the mix is now averaging 10.5%-11% of the total book. How do you really see that?

270	\icici\june-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 On the first one, I think one is that, I guess, it sort of gives us confidence in our underwriting. And I think that the two things we must remember is that on the corporate side, we were anyway, even in 2019 and 2020, coming off a very deep corporate cycle. So, it is fair to expect that in the years after that, you would have a very benign kind of credit experience. In retail and SME, the portfolio has gotten severely tested by COVID. Of course, we did see higher NPL additions during that time. From here on, we will have to see how the mix, the gross additions and recoveries and so on evolve and look at what kind of credit costs come through. But in terms of what we are sort of planning over the long term or what are our tolerance levels or what we are trying to design the business to, we would continue to look at that 20-odd percent of provisions to PPOP.

274	\icici\june-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 I think we made this contingency provision on a prudent basis. Clearly, as you would have seen the numbers in terms of the net additions as well as the net provisions, the numbers are very low. But at the same time, there are potential headwinds in the environment given what is happening on inflation and rates and potentially a sharp slowdown in growth in major economies and so on. So, given that, although the current trends are benign, we looked at our portfolio and decided to add to our contingency buffer to strengthen the balance sheet, which is a key element of our strategic framework that Sandeep also spoke about. So, that is how we looked at it. I think we'll have to see how the credit cost trajectory evolves in future.

We already offer a pay later product, which is a credit line on UPI embedded in the Bank's mobile app. We are always excited about new innovations that take place in the payment system or the financial system.	behind increase statements clear invest pay money good saying said playing comments right correct progress contribute unclear positive one launched	behind acquisitions complete participate increase answered tomorrow decline purchases statements changed clear strong invest grow confidential limited offers optimistic statement activated improvements promising announcements opportunities good saying available said playing comments use active data correct yes progress contribute bearish not unclear positive one launched over
285	\icici\june-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 So, we have given the numbers, Mahesh. 43% of the book is linked to repo, about 6% is linked to other external benchmarks and 21% is linked to MCLR. So, our MCLR, we have increased by 50 basis points at the end of May and June. Repo, as you know, has moved up by 90 basis points. And these have sort of 3 months to 1 year reset periodicity. So, that will play out over the next few quarters.

286	\icici\june-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 For example, if you look at the repo-linked portfolio, say, the mortgage portfolio. There, as you know, the floating rate product that is uniform in India has a lengthening of the EMI schedule up to a certain level, and there is only a smaller set of customers who we would see an increase in the EMI. So, in the larger corporates, I think they also have their own fair degree of resilience or ability to kind of refinance and so on. So, it should be manageable. But as I said, it depends upon the pace and extent of these changes, so we have to watch as we go along. MB Mahesh:  Second question, sir. CC/OD changes on the NPL side, I didn't get this in case it was answered. Was there any impact of it in the current quarter?	727		1	 There, as you know, the floating rate product that is uniform in India has a lengthening of the EMI schedule up to a certain level, and there is only a smaller set of customers who we would see an increase in the EMI.

I think we just have to adjust to it. There would have been some impact. Hopefully, that impact will trend down. Moderator:  Ladies and gentlemen, we take that as the last question for today. I now hand the conference call over to the management for their closing comments. Over to you, sir.	441		1	 Moderator:  Ladies and gentlemen, we take that as the last question for today.

288	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Sandeep Bakhshi  	  Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the results for Q4 of FY2021. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh and Anindya.  Thank you all for joining us today. We hope that you are safe and in good health.  The level of economic activity saw an increasing trend from January to March. The Ultra Frequency Index, comprising several high frequency indicators tracked by our Bank’s Economic Research Group rose from 106.3 in mid-January to 108.2 in March, indicating activity sustaining above pre-Covid levels. This was on the back of robust industrial activity indicators such as power demand, GST collections, rail freight revenues, e-way bill generation and higher vehicle registrations. Property registrations also continued to increase during the quarter. However, the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks has led to the re-imposition of restrictions in various states and cities which has impacted mobility indicators and economic activity. This is visible in the tapering-off of the Ultra Frequency index which has fallen to 92.3 in the week of April 18th. Going forward, economic activity will depend on the trajectory of the second wave of Covid-19, the progress of the vaccination programme, the intensity of restrictions on movement and the period for which they continue. We would like to thank the medical and health workers’ fraternity for their tireless effort in this fight against Covid-19. We express gratitude to our colleagues who continue to serve our customers despite the challenging environment.  At ICICI Bank, we have continued to steadily grow our business and franchise, while maintaining and enhancing the strength of our balance sheet.  1. Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the focused pursuit of target market segments  Our aim is to achieve risk-calibrated growth in core operating profit through a 360-degree customer centric approach, tapping opportunities across ecosystems, leveraging   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 3 of 31 internal synergies, building partnerships and decongesting processes. The core operating profit increased by 19.8% year-on-year to 85.65 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021. This is after an estimated impact of 1.75 billion Rupees of the required refund of interest on interest and related amounts charged during the moratorium period, which has been reduced from the interest income. For FY2021, the core operating profit grew by 16.9% year-on-year to 313.51 billion Rupees. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries, core operating profit grew by 17.9% year-on-year in FY2021. The profit after tax was 44.03 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021 compared to 12.21 billion Rupees in Q4 last year. For the full year, profit after tax was 161.93 billion Rupees compared to 79.31 billion Rupees in FY2020. In line with applicable guidelines, the Board has recommended a dividend of 2 Rupees per share for FY2021 subject to requisite approvals.  2. Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise  Deposit growth continued to be robust, with total deposits growing at 21.0% year-on- year at March 31, 2021. During the quarter, average current account deposits increased by 33.9% year-on-year and average savings account deposits by 21.2% year-on-year. For FY2021, the growth in average current account deposits was 25.5% year-on-year and the growth in average savings account deposits was 16.7% year-on-year. Term deposits grew by 18.4% year-on-year to 5.0 trillion Rupees at March 31, 2021. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was 138%, reflecting continued significant surplus liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system. We have focused on tapping into various ecosystems like payments, merchants and corporate ecosystems including the employees, startups, dealers and vendors. Our digital offerings and platforms and efforts towards process decongestion have played an important role in the growth of our deposit franchise.  3. Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward  Mortgage disbursements continued to increase this quarter over the previous quarter driven by our efforts to offer a convenient and frictionless experience to customers by   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 4 of 31 digitising the entire underwriting process, with instant loan approvals. Disbursements of commercial vehicles and equipment loans also increased further in Q4 over Q3. The growth in business banking continued to be robust as we continued to leverage our distribution network and our digital platforms such as InstaBIZ and Trade Online. Till April 19, 2021 we have disbursed about 127 billion Rupees under the ECLGS 1.0 scheme and about 15 billion Rupees has been disbursed under the ECLGS 2.0 scheme. Credit card spends increased substantially in Q4 of 2021 over the previous quarter driven by spends across electronics, wellness and jewellery categories. The total Amazon Pay credit cards at March 31, 2021 are about 1.6 million.  The growth in the rural portfolio was driven by jewel loans.  The retail loan portfolio grew by 19.9% year-on-year and 6.6% sequentially. The growth of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was 13.2% year-on-year and 4.7% sequentially. Overall, the domestic loan portfolio grew by 17.7% year-on-year and 6.1% sequentially. The overseas branches portfolio and within that, the non-India linked corporate portfolio, declined both sequentially and year-on- year, in line with the approach which we have articulated earlier.  4. Leveraging digital across our business  Our micromarket strategy to tap opportunities based on the market potential and 360- degree customer coverage using ICICI STACK have played a significant role in expanding our franchise and deepening relationships with our customers. We continue to strengthen our position in the digital payments ecosystem by building seamless user journeys, facilitating higher transaction throughputs and driving repeat transactions. Our strategy is to participate both directly through our own platforms and partner with third party players in the P2P and P2M space of the UPI ecosystem. We look at this transformation in payments as an opportunity to derive rich data from transactions. In December 2020, we had expanded our state-of-the-art mobile banking app, iMobile, to iMobile Pay which offers payment and banking services to customers of any bank. We have seen over 1.5 million activations of iMobile Pay from non-ICICI Bank customers within four months of its launch. We are seeing high customer engagement through repeat usage of features like Pay2Contact, Scan to Pay and bill payments among others. We have also invested in the merchant ecosystem over the last few quarters and put together a best-in-class payments stack. The monthly transaction value on our merchant   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 5 of 31 acquisition platform, Eazypay, has increased four times in March 2021 over June 2020. We have further strengthened our API stack to ensure that our customers are given best in class payment solutions. This has led to greater fund flows, growth in CASA deposits and cross-sell opportunities.  With our robust digital platforms and strong partnerships, we will continue to enhance our capabilities to compete. We are building a vast data lake to derive insights into customer behaviour, build new use cases to improve our product penetration, increase customer stickiness and improve our net promoter scores. We are also investing in new journeys and innovating existing journeys for higher value transactions through NEFT and RTGS which remain at the core of high value financial transactions.  5. Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks  The gross NPA additions, excluding borrowers in the proforma NPAs as of December 31, 2020, were 55.23 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021. The proforma NPAs have also been appropriately classified as per the RBI guidelines issued following the final judgement of the Supreme Court. For the full year FY2021, the gross additions to NPA were 161.23 billion Rupees, or about 2.2% of opening customer assets. In addition, excluding NPAs, the total fund based outstanding to all borrowers, including MSME borrowers, under resolution as per various guidelines that are in place, was 39.27 billion Rupees or about 0.5% of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2021.These are in line with or better than our expectations of NPA additions and loans under resolution.  At December 31, 2020, the Bank held aggregate Covid-19 provisions of 99.84 billion Rupees including contingency provisions of 35.09 billion Rupees for proforma NPAs. During the quarter, the Bank utilized the contingency provision of 35.09 billion Rupees held against proforma NPAs, as these loans have now been classified as per the RBI guidelines. The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 77.7% as of March 31, 2021. Further, the Bank has made additional Covid-19 related provision of 10.00 billion Rupees, and thus at March 31, 2021, the outstanding Covid-19 related provisions were 74.75 billion Rupees.    ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 6 of 31 The performance of the portfolio in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated the robustness of our underwriting and portfolio selection in recent years. Even after taking into account the higher NPA additions due to the pandemic, we have maintained a healthy provisioning coverage, including by making our provisioning policy more conservative. Further, we continue to hold Covid-19 related provisions of 74.75 billion Rupees. While the formation of gross non-performing assets in FY2022 will depend on the trajectory of the second wave of Covid-19, the progress of the vaccination programme and the pandemic-related restrictions and the period for which they continue, the portfolio performance in FY2021 and the strength of the balance sheet give us significant comfort.  6. Maintaining a strong capital base  The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 16.80% at March 31, 2021. Further, the market value of the Bank’s investments in listed subsidiaries is about 812 billion Rupees.  Looking ahead, we see many opportunities in the medium term to grow the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner. We will calibrate our growth in the near term based on the operating environment and conditions resulting from the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. We have a wide physical distribution network and our best-in- class digital platforms provide seamless onboarding and transacting experience for our customers. We continue to innovate, invest in technology and drive analytics to get deeper insights into customer behavior. Our solutions are aligned to provide the full range of banking services and capture the opportunities concentrated around economic ecosystems. Our extensive franchise, focus on digitisation and seamless delivery of products and services to customers with 360-degree coverage and strong balance sheet offer us immense opportunities to grow in a risk calibrated manner. Our approach of ‘One Bank, One RoE’ with a delayered organization architecture at the leadership level, over the last two years has helped us to leverage internal synergies. We continue to be guided by our philosophy of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank” emphasising the need to deliver fair value to customers while creating value for shareholders. We will continue to focus on delivering consistent and predictable returns to our shareholders.    ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 7 of 31 With these opening remarks, I will now hand the call over to Rakesh. 	11736		2	 Our extensive franchise, focus on digitisation and seamless delivery of products and services to customers with 360-degree coverage and strong balance sheet offer us immense opportunities to grow in a risk calibrated manner. 65 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021.

289	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, capital adequacy, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.  A. Balance sheet growth  The overall loan portfolio grew by 13.7% year-on-year at March 31, 2021. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 17.7% year-on-year and 6.1% sequentially at March 31, 2021.

Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 9.4% year-on-year. This portfolio was 666.56 billion Rupees or 9.1% of the overall loan book at March 31, 2021.  The SME business comprising borrowers with a turnover of less than 2.5 billion Rupees grew by 32.5% year-on-year to 302.84 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021.  The growth of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was 13.2% year-on-year and 4.7% sequentially, driven by disbursements to higher rated corporates and PSUs across various sectors to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements.  The overseas loan portfolio declined by 27.9% year-on-year at March 31, 2021. The overseas loan portfolio was 5.1% of the overall loan book at March 31, 2021. We had mentioned in our previous quarter earnings call that we would be progressively exiting our non-India linked exposures in a planned manner. The non-India linked corporate portfolio reduced by 56.0% or about 1.6 billion US Dollars year-on-year and 24.0% or about 391 million US Dollars sequentially, at March 31, 2021.    ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 8 of 31 Coming to the funding side: We continue to focus on growing the daily average CASA balances and retail term deposits. Average savings account deposits increased by 21.2% year-on-year and average current account deposits increased by 33.9% year-on-year during the quarter. For FY2021, the growth in average current account deposits was 25.5% year-on-year and the growth in average savings account deposits was 16.7% year-on-year. Total term deposits grew by 18.4% year-on-year to 5.0 trillion Rupees at March 31, 2021.  B.

The gross NPA additions from the retail portfolio, excluding borrowers in the proforma NPAs, were 43.55 billion Rupees. The gross NPA additions from the corporate and SME portfolio, excluding borrowers in the proforma NPAs, were 11.68 billion Rupees, of which 10.67 billion Rupees was from the portfolio rated BB and below as of December 31, 2020. The corporate and SME NPA additions include one account in the construction sector which was rated BB and below at December 31 and was classified as non-performing during Q4 and upgraded in the same quarter post the implementation by all lenders of a resolution plan as per RBI’s framework.  Recoveries and upgrades, excluding recoveries from proforma NPAs as of December 31, 2020, write-offs and sale, were 25.60 billion Rupees in the current quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 8.20 billion Rupees from the retail portfolio and 17.40 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 27.45 billion Rupees.

The gross NPA ratio declined to 4.96% at March 31, 2021 from to 5.42% on a proforma basis at December 31, 2020 and the net NPA ratio declined to 1.14% at March 31, 2021 from 1.26% on a proforma basis at December 31, 2020. Till the last quarter, we used to report non-fund outstanding to NPAs as a part of the BB and below portfolio. From this quarter, we are excluding it from the BB and below portfolio and reporting it separately. The non-fund   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 9 of 31 based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 44.05 billion Rupees as of March 31, 2021 compared to 44.07 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 14.92 billion Rupees as of March 31, 2021 on this non- fund based outstanding.  Excluding NPAs, the total fund based outstanding to all borrowers, including MSME borrowers, under resolution as per various guidelines was about 39.27 billion Rupees or about 0.5% of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2021. Of the above fund based outstanding, 20.12 billion Rupees was from the retail loan portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 7.16 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is in excess of the requirement as per RBI guidelines.  The percentage of performing retail EMI products and the credit card portfolio which was overdue was marginally higher compared to pre-Covid levels at March 31, 2021 and about 1.5% higher at December-end and 4% higher at September-end. The percentage of the performing SME and business banking portfolio which was overdue had reached pre-covid levels at September-end and continues to remain so at March-end as well. The percentage of the performing rural portfolio which was overdue at March 31, 2021 was about 2.5% higher than the normal pre-Covid trend compared to about 1.5% higher at December-end and 1% higher at September-end. About 2% of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was overdue at March-end, which was similar compared to December-end and September-end.  C. P&L Details  Net interest income increased by 16.8% year-on-year to 104.31 billion Rupees. Interest on income tax refund was 0.11 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 1.96 billion Rupees in the previous quarter and 0.27 billion Rupees in Q4 of last year. The net interest margin was at 3.84% in Q4 of 2021 compared to 3.67% in the previous quarter and 3.87% in Q4 of last year. The impact of interest on income tax refund and interest collections from NPAs was about 4 basis points this quarter compared to about 11 basis points in the previous quarter and about 4 basis points in Q4 of last year. As per the judgement of the Supreme Court, an estimated amount of 1.75 billion Rupees of the required refund of interest on interest and related amounts accrued on loans during the   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 10 of 31 moratorium period has been reduced from the interest income in Q4 of 2021. The domestic NIM was at 3.94% this quarter compared to 3.78% in Q3 and 4.14% in Q4 last year. International margins were at 0.44%. The cost of deposits was 3.80% in Q4 compared to 3.97% in Q3.

On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 3.6% year-on-year in Q4. The employee expenses decreased by 10.2% year-on-year primarily due to decline in provisions for retirals reflecting the increase in yields on government securities during the quarter compared to the decline in yields in Q4 last year. The Bank had 98,750 employees at March 31, 2021. Non-employee expenses increased by 12.3% year-on- year in Q4 of 2021 due to increase in retail business related costs and technology related expenses partly offset by decrease in advertisement and sales promotion expenses. For FY2021, employee expenses decreased by 2.2% year-on-year and non-employee expenses increased by 0.9% year-on-year. We continue to make investments in technology and to grow our franchise.  The core operating profit increased by 19.8% year-on-year to 85.65 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021. For FY2021, the core operating profit grew by 16.9% year-on-year to 313.51 billion Rupees.

There was a treasury loss of 0.25 billion Rupees this quarter compared to a profit of 7.66 billion Rupees in Q3. The loss during the quarter reflects the increase in yields on fixed income and government securities.    ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 11 of 31 The net provisions during the quarter were 28.83 billion. At December 31, 2020, the Bank held aggregate Covid-19 provisions of 99.84 billion Rupees including contingency provisions of 35.09 billion Rupees for proforma NPAs. During the quarter, the Bank utilized the contingency provision of 35.09 billion Rupees held against proforma NPAs, as these loans have now been classified as per the RBI guidelines. The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 77.7% as of March 31, 2021.  Further, the Bank has made additional Covid-19 related provision of 10.00 billion Rupees and thus at March 31, 2021, the outstanding Covid-19 related provisions were 74.75 billion Rupees. At March 31, 2021, the total outstanding Covid-19 related provisions, provisions for non-fund based outstanding to NPAs, general provisions on standard assets and other standard asset provisions were 141.44 billion Rupees or 1.9% of loans.  The total net provisions made during the year were 162.14 billion Rupees. These include Covid-19 related provision made during the year, net of utilisation during the year, of 47.50 billion Rupees; and additional provisions made reflecting our change in our provisioning policy, of about 26 billion Rupees. Excluding the same, the provisions were 88.64 billion Rupees or about 1.35% of average advances in FY2021. In our previous earnings calls, we have mentioned that the normalised credit cost level for our portfolio would be about 1.2-1.3%. Compared to our expected normalized level of credit costs, the provisions, excluding Covid-19 related provisions and the impact of change in provisioning policy, were higher by about 15 basis points or about 10 billion Rupees.  As Sandeep mentioned, the performance of the portfolio in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated the robustness of our underwriting and portfolio selection in recent years. We have high provisioning coverage on NPAs and in addition we continue to hold Covid- 19 related provisions of 74.75 billion Rupees, which is about 1% of loans and substantially higher than the provisions in excess of the normalized level in FY2021. We are therefore confident of the strength and resilience of our balance sheet.  The profit before tax was 56.57 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021 compared to 14.23 billion Rupees in Q4 last year. The tax expense was 12.54 billion in Q4 of 2021 compared to 2.02 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit after tax was 44.03 billion Rupees in Q4 this year compared to 12.21 billion Rupees in Q4 of last year.

The consolidated profit after tax was 183.84 billion Rupees in FY2021 compared to 95.66 billion Rupees in FY2020.  D. Capital  The CET1 ratio, was 16.80% at March 31, 2021 compared to 16.79% at December 31, 2020. The Tier 1 ratio was 18.06% and the total capital adequacy ratio was 19.12% at March 31, 2021.  E. Portfolio information  We are focused on growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward. Our retail is built based on proprietary data and analytics in addition to bureau checks, and well-priced in relation to the risk. Our strong deposit franchise enables us to offer competitive pricing to the selected customer segments. The portfolio level build-up strategy for the retail loan book has been based on utilising the existing customer database for sourcing key retail asset products through cross sell and up-sell. The loan disbursements across various retail products had increased beyond pre-Covid levels in Q4 driven by pickup in economic activity and our efforts towards process decongestions and digitization of underwriting and customer onboarding process. We had calibrated our sourcing towards stronger profiles immediately after the onset of Covid-19 last year and are continuing with the same approach. We have also been cautious in underwriting proposals related to sectors directly impacted by Covid-19. We are prepared for additional calibrated response in view of the second wave of the Covid- 19 pandemic and are watching the developments closely. We have given further information on our portfolio in slides 32 to 42 of our investor presentation.  The loan and non-fund based outstanding to corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and below (excluding fund and non-fund based outstanding to NPAs) was 130.98 billion   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 13 of 31 Rupees at March 31, 2021 compared to 136.54 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020, details of which are given on slide 34 of the investor presentation. Other than two accounts, one each in construction and telecom sectors, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021.

In Q4 of 2021:   The rating downgrades from investment grade categories were 11.87 billion Rupees. The downgrades were largely from the infrastructure sector;  The upgrades and net decrease in outstanding were 14.97 billion Rupees;  There was a reduction of 10.67 billion Rupees due to slippage of some borrowers to the non-performing category; and  There were upgrades of 8.21 billion Rupees from NPA to below investment grade categories  Except a few accounts with aggregate outstanding of about 4 billion Rupees, all corporate and SME borrowers under resolution were rated below investment grade at March 31, 2021. This mainly includes one lease rental discounting account and two projects under implementation account in the commercial real estate sector.  The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans and working capital loans was 226.71 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021 or 3% of our total loan portfolio.

The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 645.09 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021 compared to 576.29 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020.

The sequential increase in the outstanding during the quarter was mainly due to increase in outstanding to government owned NBFCs. The proportion of the NBFC and HFC portfolio internally rated BB and below or non-performing is about 1%.  Coming to our overseas portfolio, excluding exposures to financial institutions and retail lending against deposits, the total corporate fund and non-fund outstanding of overseas branches, net of cash or bank or insurance backed lending, was 4.14 billion US dollars at March 31, 2021 compared to 5.20 billion US dollars at December 31, 2020 and 7.48 billion US dollars at March 31, 2020. 70% of the outstanding at March 31, 2021 was to Indian corporates and their subsidiaries and joint ventures. 16% of the outstanding was to non-India companies with Indian or India-linked operations and activities. The portfolio in this segment is well-rated and the Indian operations of these companies are target customers for the Bank’s deposit and transaction banking franchise, and we would continue to pursue risk-calibrated opportunities in this segment. 6% of the outstanding was to companies owned by NRIs or PIOs. 8% of the outstanding was to other non-India companies which is less than 1% of the total portfolio of the Bank.

290	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Mahrukh Adajania  	 I have a couple of questions. Firstly, in terms of credit costs, now that you continue to hold good enough COVID provision, can we still expect the credit cost to be in the range of 1.2% to 1.3% in FY2022, despite the second wave of Covid-19?	243		1	3% in FY2022, despite the second wave of Covid-19.

As I said, we are confident about the portfolio in terms of the underwriting that we have done. We have stuck to stronger profiles in terms of underwriting plus from a balance sheet point of view, the NPAs are well covered. We are carrying surplus provisions of slightly over 1% of loans. All of that does give us confidence. But as we have said earlier also, the pandemic trajectory is something that we cannot predict, and that's something we will have to just see and right now, it's very difficult to comment on that given the situation which is there.	769		2	 We have stuck to stronger profiles in terms of underwriting plus from a balance sheet point of view, the NPAs are well covered.

295	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 Mahrukh, there are a few things. One of course, is that our retail portfolio itself has grown significantly over the last two or three years. Further, on the portfolio itself, aside from the pandemic, even prior to that, we had said that we will see some increase in addition to NPAs as the portfolio kind of seasons. So, that impact was anyway expected. Also, on the retail side, it's very important to see both gross additions as well as the gross deletions and upgrades, because that's something which happens on a continuous basis. Right now, again, given the second wave of COVID that we are seeing currently, we'll have to just wait and see how this trajectory unfolds, how the vaccination drive kind of goes ahead, what steps are taken in terms of lockdowns and restrictions. So, all of that we will have to kind of wait and watch for maybe a month or two, before one can comment on a more precise outlook.	914		2	 Also, on the retail side, it's very important to see both gross additions as well as the gross deletions and upgrades, because that's something which happens on a continuous basis.

297	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 It's about 98,750. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Suresh from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Suresh: I had a question for both Anup and Vishakha. More of a qualitative aspect because the retail loan growth is about 20% y-o-y, almost double that of the system. The overall domestic loan book is 18% y-o-y, three times the growth of the system. You have done this at a time which has been exceptionally tough for everyone. So, the worry a lot of people have is ICICI Bank back to its old days of very high growth, especially coming in a pandemic year. Can you give a qualitative assessment both in the retail as well as the corporate book that you are very confident that this is no adverse selection of assets and   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 18 of 31 you're very confident that these are genuine assets taken on board? Is it a market share gain purely, any color on that would be appreciated?	929		2	The next question is from the line of Suresh from Macquarie.  Suresh: I had a question for both Anup and Vishakha.  More of a qualitative aspect because the retail loan growth is about 20% y-o-y, almost double that of the system.	good increase said comments data grow right correct unclear yes figures	buying behind increase underperformed wrong mistake changed clear negative grow invest suffered dead money statement appreciated continue figures problems calculations fail good follow benefit concerns said comments data right correct yes bullish progress contribute struggled bearish numbers comment not unclear positive over
298	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Suresh, let me go first. Two or three things, one is that our retail asset has been consistently growing. It is not just this year, actually, if you go back a few quarters before that, it has been quite solid, this year also it has been quite solid. I feel that there are a couple of reasons for that; one is that during pandemic, I must say that because of our work on the digital side, we were able to capture opportunities perhaps faster than most others. Particularly if you see on the non-mortgage business, over the last one to one and a half years and ICICI STACK, etc., we have worked very, very hard on making sure that the credit delivery is as seamless as possible, as fast as possible and we have worked hard on the underwriting abilities on the digital footprint so that we make sure that most of the things are pre-approved, and we have tightened the whole process of credit delivery, so that we are able to do the credit delivery faster, better and to good profile customers. So, I would say that market share gain essentially has come on back of that and the book has gone through the stress of COVID. As Rakesh mentioned in his remarks, it has reasonably stood the test of the stress so far. We look at them very closely, particularly on the business loan and SME side, data on the credit summation. So, far they are holding on quite well. On the mortgage side, I must add that again decongestion, the fact of the matter is that we were slightly under penetrated in our own customer base and competitive pricing and the fact that we had used our physical distribution, but more than that on the digital tilt, I would say it did help us in gaining share. Overall I would put 60% weightage on the fact that we had worked on the process of credit delivery, that has helped us in gaining share. I would also put 20% on the fact that the competitive intensity had come down a little bit more so, because in our case, the contrast of the digital nature of our processes vis-à-vis many others who may not have that level of digitization in the processes which makes the whole credit delivery process itself slower. And in times like these, faster credit is also an important capital, which clients are looking at when all things remaining equal. So, that has also helped. And on the MSME side, InstaBIZ and Trade Online and all of it that has also helped in moving the clients towards us. So, I would say that these would be the reasons why we have been able to gain share from the market.

299	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Vishakha Mulye 	  So, quickly on the corporate side, if you look at the last three to four years, we have been growing at around 13% to 15% on the domestic performing book, mainly driven by the higher rated corporates as well as PSUs. Therefore, our portfolio is seasoned in terms of the disbursement that we have done in the last three to four years. If you look at it, I think the test was during the last one year when RBI came out with the restructuring guidelines. Our restructured book is less than 1% of our total book. So our portfolio has actually stood the test of the extreme impact of the COVID in the last one year. The incremental addition to NPL has come down and actually has tapered during the last one year. Last quarter also it has been quite low. Again, this is driven mainly by the opportunities which are there in the market in terms of deploying liquidity even in the short term. So, to be frank, I feel quite nice about the portfolio and we'll of course have to watch, as Rakesh spoke about the second wave. But at the moment, we feel very nice about the performing portfolio on the corporate side.	1106		0	 So, to be frank, I feel quite nice about the portfolio and we'll of course have to watch, as Rakesh spoke about the second wave.

300	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Sandeep Batra 	  Suresh, Sandeep Batra here. As Rakesh also mentioned, if you see the rating mix of our loan portfolio, that has changed for the Bank as a whole. I draw your attention to slide 33. If you look at the A-minus and above portfolio, in 2017 it was 56%, it is now 73%. Even if I compare it to a year back, it was about 70%. So, there is clearly a focus on quality. The book what you're really talking about now to what it was in the past is significantly different if you see it from a rating perspective. Moderator:  Thank you. Next question is from the line of Rohan Mandora from Equirus.

302	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 In terms of the retail collection, I think April is just way too early to comment on, even as we see those trends, it is just too early. It is logical to expect that all lenders would have seen some impact of the second wave on the collections and for us it would be no different. But like I said, I think we have to wait for a month or two to really gauge how this plays out and how things evolve. Again from last year, our experience was it is better not to jump to conclusions very soon. We will have to wait and see. On the portfolio, Anup talked about on how we have been focused in terms of our underwriting. So we are confident that it should play out well.	665		1	 But like I said, I think we have to wait for a month or two to really gauge how this plays out and how things evolve.

303	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  On the underwriting part, first is that unsecured lending is to better pre-approved customers and through straight through processing. On the business banking and other parts, in addition to complete straight through processing, score cards really help. We have seen that as the ticket sizes come down and as the portfolio which has large numbers coming in, score cards give a much better output than human intervention in credit decisioning with its own flavors of overriding the credit. So, we have seen time and again that scorecard gives you better credit decisioning but you have to keep updating the scorecard with the inputs and the learning that you get from this credit. So basically you have to keep refreshing the scorecards, but it takes away the bias in credit decisioning when you have very large number of cases. On the unsecured side, the beauty is that you can do full straight through processing. For example, on the credit card and personal loan side with the video KYC coming in, it is like complete straight through processing. And when you do it to your own customers, it is even better. We have solid underwriting abilities and credit delivery processes. Artificial intelligence, machine learning is used to figure out patterns and most importantly in getting the feedback of the early warning signal back into credit underwriting processes. The biggest learning essentially comes from cases which become overdue because they are from a pre- delinquency management and the cases which will become overdue because they actually give a lot of feedback about updating scorecard, credit models to ensure that we are going exactly where we would want to go. I would not say that for a larger loan, but for retail essentially the ROA comes from NIM plus fees, less cost of acquisition, less operating expenses, less cost of collection, less credit cost and that is where it flows. We   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 21 of 31 can actually do intervention basis micro market, the customer segment on the yields and fees. Internally also there is a lot of scope on cost of acquisition if we lend to our internal customers, reducing the operating expenses which can be done through digital models and making it straight through and decongesting our processes completely and collection costs by making sure that we do pre-delinquency management and predominantly most of our collections is now digital. It is not physical at all. Thus when we select the profile, the client segment and the product properly, we also manage the credit cost. So, all the seven variables we look at it as one, we don't look at individual variables in isolation. We don't think that's the right way of looking at a business in retail because we have opportunities everywhere. However, as we move up that is on the business loans and SMEs, because the number of cases are small, it is not that much amenable to artificial intelligence and machine learning, but you do get on sectors. There the artificial intelligence and machine learning essentially comes in early warning signals, credit summation, which is the inflows and outflows. So, there's a lot of work that we do on the inflows and outflows and ensure whether there is volatility or whether there is stability, whether it is increasing, decreasing etc., The credit decisioning essentially happens on the scorecard which again gets used when we get input from all these variables back into the model. In case of mortgage, is more difficult because unfortunately the collateral part of the mortgage is not standardized, the title searches are not so much online. Where we have a very large collateral, the value of the collateral that today is not very amenable to full digitization. But the good thing is that even the land titles, etc., are becoming digital as we move on. We have seen for example, in auto VAHAN coming in and there are a lot of stuff which is getting more digital and so our ability to check fraud and other things is improving by the day. We feel that going forward, we are convinced that digital using artificial intelligence and machine learning, using everything which is available digitally but putting it altogether and synthesizing it is the way to go. It reduces internal cost, congestion in the processes and helps us in our ability to pick up good customers at a faster speed. Moderator: Thank you.

304	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Abhishek Murarka 	  I have one question on the payments disclosure that you have made. So, in debit cards, the value and volume both have fallen and in the last quarter you had mentioned that some inactive cards are being culled. But this quarter the drop in the number of cards is actually quite sharp and same with the volume. The second observation is that in UPI P2M even those volumes and values have fallen, and I would have thought that if UPI is actually cannibalizing some of the card payments, at least volumes would have increased there. So, can you just sort of elaborate on what should be happening on the payment instrument and the payment volume side?	648		0	I have one question on the payments disclosure that you have made.

305	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  On the number of debit cards, we are sort of flushing the inactive cards out of the system, which is why you will see that the number of cards would have fallen. As far as share is concerned, the debit card market share has not moved. However, if you look at different payment systems, UPI certainly will over a period of time, put pressure on debit cards because the proposition of UPI is almost as strong as a debit card proposition. So, that is what is going to happen. Between credit cards and other modes of payment we don't think that the cannibalization will be that fast. So, we'll have to look at all payments system and our bet is that we have to keep betting on all payment systems and things which are growing. We have to ensure that we partner, make it open architecture like what we have done. We are sort of very clear that that is the way to go. As you know payments standalone may or may not make you money, for us, it will never make money on a standalone basis fully. But for us, the moment we get more and more digital footprint we are able to put it in the underwriting because it is a behavioral data and the velocity of the data is more important than the static data. Earlier it used to be static data only on demographics, age, etc. It's not that static data is not important, but it is important to keep capturing data with high velocity and the behavioral characteristics that helps us underwrite better. So, we can use the data to underwrite and we are using that data to underwrite. Now we are seeing in FASTag, very good quality data comes in with payments. On the debit card payments, no loss in market share, but UPI will cannibalize, and we feel that it will cannibalize every part to some extent.

I think, if you go back to last year, what we had seen that for a period of a few months, the loan demand was lower, the collections were impacted. So, we have to see how it plays out. Our focus is to ensure that we continue to raise low-cost deposits, keep our cost of deposits amongst the best in the industry, which then allows us to do well-rated lending, while earning a good amount of spread as well. So, for us, that is the key focus and then continue to be efficient in terms of expenses and focus on the core fee franchise. But all of this is with the focus on core operating profit. So, it's very difficult to say, how it will get impacted. If things go really bad, of course, we will calibrate our growth also accordingly. So, let's see how it plays out.

313	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Vishakha Mulye 	  The most important thing as I said that there are two-three principles that we are following; one is return of capital is the paramount underlying principle and we look at risk calibrated operating profit. If you look at our growth in the last three to four years, as I said, depending upon the market conditions, performing loan book has grown between 10% to 15%. Second driver for the profitability is that we look at not only providing the solution to the corporates but also to the entire ecosystem. Therefore, there are various drivers of the fee income. We try to capture the entire ecosystem of the corporates, including the money in motion within the ecosystem. This further drives addition to the NII that we have, of course providing the solution on the transaction banking side, providing the solution on the forex and derivatives side. We also have been ranked as number one on the Prime league table for the bonds. So depending upon the market condition, we provide solutions to our corporates in terms of underwriting the large bond issuances and then distributing it in the market. Similarly, when it comes to the various segments that I spoke about, there are new segments of the clients that we have started focusing on. In addition to the traditional manufacturing, the other focus area that we have identified is the entire service sector. We are focusing largely on the entire institutional investors, we call it as Financial sponsors, and provide the complete solution to them in terms of not only giving them services at their level. If I take an example of a financial sponsor, not only providing the solution at the AMC level, but at a fund level including the investee company level. So, I think if you look at the overall offering for the corporate that we have created and the franchises that we have built over the last four years with underlying principle of return of capital, I'm quite confident that the franchise is sustainable and delivering the results that we have seen in the past.	2020		1	 We are focusing largely on the entire institutional investors, we call it as Financial sponsors, and provide the complete solution to them in terms of not only giving them services at their level.  We try to capture the entire ecosystem of the corporates, including the money in motion within the ecosystem. The most important thing as I said that there are two-three principles that we are following; one is return of capital is the paramount underlying principle and we look at risk calibrated operating profit.  In addition to the traditional manufacturing, the other focus area that we have identified is the entire service sector.  Similarly, when it comes to the various segments that I spoke about, there are new segments of the clients that we have started focusing on.  Therefore, there are various drivers of the fee income.	behind acquisitions complete missing there wrong stable grow changed clear invest here important undervalued confidential money improving products clients figures profitability identified focus return orders changing good profit saying solutions said failed started right correct yes following intact progress investments growing that contribute below expanding changes unclear positive expand history over	acquisitions participate invest removed undervalued loans reported statement clients identified orders profit said failed different revenue contribute growing expanding neutral here ticker release confidential money second figures grown solutions saying yes intact ratings changes positive expand history clearer complete answered underperformed ranked concerned changed important trades expanded profitability focus changing good growth private right following progress investments announced launched over behind increase missing there wrong stable grow clear unchanged limited offers improving products return benefit slowing started sustainable correct below selected unclear

On the retail slippages could you indicate or just quantify what the mortgage slippages could have been? The reason why I'm asking that is that may really not require a 70%, 80% cover, right, which we have in our NPA book. So, if you can just quantify out of the Rs. 125 billion or Rs. 130 billion of slippages, how much is mortgages this year?

One is can you indicate what is the technology spends to revenue, if you can just give what this number would have been for the last year and year before last? And secondly, just on the corporate banking, how would the operating profit margins be in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020?	497		1	You can assume we have more some more buffer in the coverage ratio than that.

318	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	 We don't disclose the technology spends separately. Again, there is no uniform way of doing that across banks. Like I said earlier, I think in terms of all the investments that are required, we are very happy to make them. If I look at our operating expenses, our capital expenditure, the line item which has been growing for us is indeed the technology expenses and other franchise-related expenses. On the corporate side, there are a couple of things; one, of course is if you look at below the operating margin, the provisions like Vishakha was mentioning earlier, within the last couple of years we have not really seen   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 27 of 31 much NPA additions. So, the provisions pretty much had normalized for that part of the portfolio in the last financial year. On the operating profit, I think what we have been able to do is to kind of maintain that or see some slight improvement despite the increased focus on better rated exposures. So, the way we look at it is, one, of course, is just the corporate part of the business, in which itself, we would have been able to do that. The lower cost of deposits has definitely helped there, as well as the focus that Vishakha talked about on the transaction banking. What has reduced for us, Saurabh, and that would have had some impact on a y-o-y basis, is the loan processing or the credit linked fees which is there because that's something which you don't really get if you're lending primarily to ‘A and above’ rated clients. But other than that, we would have seen an improvement in other aspects. And more importantly, I think the entire focus for us has been on the ecosystem. So, we don't look at just what we are making from the corporate client or what opportunities are there with the corporate client. Along with the retail team, the corporate team works to look at what all we can do with the employees of the corporate on raising deposits, issuing credit cards, lending. Similarly, on the dealer, vendor, the SME part of the business also works along. So, what we look at is not just the corporate revenue but also the retail and the SME piece in aggregate. That focus has really sharpened over the last I would say 12 months or so, and that is something which is very helpful in maintaining the profitability despite the focus on the higher rated clients. Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manish Shukla from Citigroup. Please go ahead.	2460		1	 On the corporate side, there are a couple of things; one, of course is if you look at below the operating margin, the provisions like Vishakha was mentioning earlier, within the last couple of years we have not really seen   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 27 of 31 much NPA additions.

320	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 I think if we look at the trends that we have been seeing, in the first quarter, we were down about 30% y-o-y and from there on, the y-o-y numbers have been improving for us. I think in the last quarter, we were pretty much flat and now we are at about a 6% growth. I think for us maybe on the corporate side, the loan processing fees, that is   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 28 of 31 something which will not have grown or declined a bit, because that is not the focus area for us. Other fee revenues have been doing well, the retail lending linked fees or the other fees post the first half of the year when the decline was there. So, nothing really to worry on that trend. As we have said earlier, I think each of the businesses looks at the core operating profit as the key metric. So, it's a combination of NII, fees and expenses, and we try to optimize the three levers to get the best outcome possible on a risk calibrated basis for the core operating profit.	974		0	I think if we look at the trends that we have been seeing, in the first quarter, we were down about 30% y-o-y and from there on, the y-o-y numbers have been improving for us.

324	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	 So, again, I will not talk about the near-term, but in the medium-term, as we target to grow our risk calibrated core operating profit, one of the drivers will definitely be to grow our revenues faster than expenses. And that is a focus area for us. So, we definitely believe that in the medium to long term, that's something which should happen. We don't have any internal metric or a number that we are targeting there or any timeline for that. But just the focus on the core operating profit, I think expenses is also an important variable to manage that. But we would continue to make investments or make expenses, capital expenditure or revenue for all areas where we believe it will help us in the long-   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 29 of 31 term for franchise, technology distribution, people, all of those expenses, we will make, if required, we will make them upfront as well. So, that's how we look at it, Manish. Moderator: Thank you. We'll be able to take one last question from the line of Krishnan from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead. Krishnan: I had two questions. One, whether you have any fungibility to move housing loan assets from the home finance portfolio to the Bank portfolio at all. Is that something that has happened in this last year, because most of your retail growth has not come on personal loans or credit cards, but seem to have come on the back of the housing loan portfolio this time around. Just wanted to make sure that it’s all organic and there is no fungibility, even if that's something allowed? Number two, wanted to understand just on the credit card portfolio that you have incrementally been building. Obviously the competitive intensity coming off has been a tailwind for you. Just wanted to understand how would you look at raising the receivables on the card portfolio given that one of the big metrics that you should ideally try to maximize, you are about 20% below where the peers seem to be. So if you could just help us understand what are you doing about raising the receivables for card?	2056		2	 Number two, wanted to understand just on the credit card portfolio that you have incrementally been building.

325	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Krishnan, Part-A are HFC assets moving to the bank. Actually if you look at the number, HFC’s portfolio is very small, it is about 5% of the mortgage portfolio of ICICI Bank. So, there is nothing material which will move from there to here. It's all organic within ICICI Bank and that is the way one should look at it. Second one is on credit cards. Two, three things. First is that from a credit card perspective, you would have seen that the numbers of credit cards that we are issuing is very healthy. We look at credit card from two angles. Credit card is one of the high frequency usage product and the brand gets reinforced every time you use a credit card and if it is ICICI Bank credit card and you're fetching credit card or using credit card, the brand gets reinforced. It is one of the very few high frequency products. So, we look at credit card also from a liability perspective and make sure that the customer is primary with us. That is one. Second one also is that the credit   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 30 of 31 card is a very profitable portfolio and on credit card you make some money on spends and some money on revolvers. The money that we make on revolvers depends on what kind of revolvers we have. We always like episodic revolvers who are people who revolve from time-to-time but they are not chronic revolvers. That is one mining we continuously keep doing. And that is our approach. Our approach is not just growing the book on the credit card. We would want to have a healthy mix of making customers primary, having not only large spenders also but also episodic revolvers. We don't like chronic revolvers on our books, chronic revolvers in general do badly over a cycle. Krishnan: My only point was you and a few other issuers obviously have now mastered or perfected the art of delivering 4.5%, 5%, 6% ROA on the credit card because you have higher set of security in running that. But now it's about where you can take the unit to profitability because everybody can generate a 5% or 4.5% when you give or take 50 basis, 100 basis points, everybody is there and thereabouts in which is a mature player. From a unit profitability perspective, one of the big variables will be receivable per card which is where you have been generally conservative given the kind of episode that happened the last time. I just wanted to understand what can you do about that?	2401		1	 So, there is nothing material which will move from there to here.  That is one mining we continuously keep doing.

326	\icici\mar-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  It's an important question. There we keep experimenting with receivables per card. And we don't look at averages, we look at distribution very closely. When we look at distribution, we also look at the stability of the distribution closely as to how many are episodic, how many are chronic, because chronic revolvers obviously are very profitable for some time and then they just go out of the system. So, that is one experiment that we continuously keep doing within our micro segment of customers. As you know there is no sort of perfect answer, it is a science, but it's also an art and art comes to science and that cycle keeps moving in credit card. Also, the function is we have seen in this COVID time, it hasn't behaved much worse because now over a period of time it is becoming a very important source of credit. And in tough times people do require sometimes one month of serving the extra credit. And that comes by way of credit cards, because they can repay at will. So, that is another behavior change or behavior that we have seen in COVID. So, it is behaving reasonably well. But it's a function of   ICICI Bank Ltd April 24, 2021   Page 31 of 31 experimentation that we keep doing. We experiment small and we test and learn and then we scale up and then we kill some segments which don't prove to be a winner. So, that's a constant thing. But will we go and aggressively increase our receivable for card without testing? The answer is no. Moderator: Thank you very much. We will take that as the last question. I would now like to hand the conference back to the management team for closing comments.	1619		1	 Also, the function is we have seen in this COVID time, it hasn't behaved much worse because now over a period of time it is becoming a very important source of credit.

I      Page 2 of 26 now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Bakhshi -- Managing Director and CEO of ICICI Bank. Thank you and over to you, sir. Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks  Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the results for Q4 of FY2022. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh and Anindya.  We hope that you are safe and in good health.  In January we saw a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases that resulted in a moderation in the pace of economic activity. However, the impact of this third wave of the pandemic was mild and with the decline in number of new Covid-19 cases, economic activity gained momentum in the months of February and March. This was visible in the Bank’s Ultra Frequency Index, comprising several high frequency indicators tracked by our Economic Research Group, which rose from 112.0 in January to 114.9 in February and 124.4 in March. Some of the major factors leading to improvement in this index were increase in power demand, rail freight revenues, e-way bill generation and GST collections. We extend our gratitude to the medical and health workers’ fraternity for their tireless effort in this fight against Covid-19.  At ICICI Bank, we aim to grow the core operating profit within the guardrails of compliance and risk through our 360-degree customer-centric approach and focus on opportunities across client and segment ecosystems. We focus on growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward, with return of capital and containment of provisions below a defined percentage of core operating profit being a key imperative. We follow a micro market based approach to create an efficient distribution and resource allocation strategy by using analytics to identify opportunities. We aim to steadily grow our business within our strategic framework and strengthen our franchise, delivery, and servicing capabilities, backed by a range of digital initiatives.           Page 3 of 26 Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:   First- Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the focused pursuit of target market segments  The core operating profit increased by 18.7% year-on-year to 101.64 billion Rupees in this quarter and 22.3% year-on-year to 383.47 billion Rupees in FY2022. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries and associates, core operating profit grew by 21.0% year-on- year in Q4 of 2022.

332	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Rakesh’s opening remarks 	  Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.  A. Balance sheet growth  Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Up to the last quarter, we used to report rural loans as a part of the retail portfolio. From this quarter, we are reporting rural separately. The retail loan portfolio, excluding rural loans, grew by 19.7% year-on- year and 6.0% sequentially at March 31, 2022. Coming to the growth across retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 20.3% year-on-year, and auto loans by 11.3%. The commercial vehicles and equipment portfolio declined by 1.3% year-on-year. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 31.9% year-on-year. This portfolio was 879.35 billion Rupees or 10.2% of the overall loan book at March 31, 2022. The rural loan portfolio increased by 6.5% year-on-year and 4.3% sequentially. The retail and rural portfolio together grew by 17.6% year-on-year and 5.8% sequentially.  The overseas loan portfolio, in US dollar terms, grew by 5.9% year-on-year and was flat sequentially at March 31, 2022. The year-on-year increase in the overseas loan portfolio was primarily due to increase in the India-linked trade finance book. The overseas loan portfolio was 4.8% of the overall loan book at March 31, 2022. The non-India linked corporate portfolio reduced by 48.2% or about 597 million US Dollars year-on-year and 6.8% or about 47 million US Dollars sequentially. Of the overseas corporate portfolio, about 82% comprises Indian corporates, 10% is overseas corporates with Indian linkage, 4% comprises companies owned by NRIs or PIOs and balance 4% is non-India corporates. Our direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is negligible. We have exposure to an Indian oil refinery rated AA- externally where a sanctioned Russian entity owns 49% stake. The exposure is largely non-fund in nature. The oil refinery’s operations are largely in India.  Coming to the funding side: average savings account deposits increased by 22.7% year- on-year in Q4 and 23.5% year-on-year in FY2022. Average current account deposits increased by 23.6% year-on-year in Q4 and 31.0% year-on-year in FY2022. Total term deposits grew by 9.0% year-on-year at March 31, 2022.      Page 7 of 26 B. Credit quality  The net deletions from gross NPAs were 4.89 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 1.91 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There were net additions of 1.23 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the retail, rural and business banking portfolios and net deletions of 6.12 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the corporate and SME portfolios.  The gross NPA additions were 42.04 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 40.18 in the previous quarter.

Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 46.93 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 42.09 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 36.13 billion Rupees from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 10.80 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. Corporate and SME recoveries and upgrades include a power sector account which was upgraded post implementation of a resolution plan under IBC. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 26.44 billion Rupees.  The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 36.40 billion Rupees as of March 31, 2022 compared to 36.38 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2021. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 20.51 billion Rupees as of March 31, 2022 against this non-fund based outstanding.  The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers, under resolution as per various guidelines declined to 82.67 billion Rupees or about 1.0% of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2022 from 96.84 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2021. The sequential decline was mainly due to prepayment by a borrower in the construction sector. Of the total fund based outstanding under resolution at March 31, 2022, 60.43 billion Rupees was from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 22.24 billion Rupees was from the corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 25.30 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines.         Page 8 of 26 C. P&L Details  Net interest income increased by 20.8% year-on-year to 126.05 billion Rupees. The net interest margin was at 4.00% in this quarter compared to 3.96% in the previous quarter and 3.84% in Q4 of last year.

Non-employee expenses increased by 15.6% year- on-year in this quarter primarily due to retail business and technology related expenses. The technology expenses were about 8.5% of our operating expenses in FY2022.  The core operating profit increased by 18.7% year-on-year to 101.64 billion Rupees in this quarter.

The total provisions during the quarter were 10.69 billion Rupees or 10.5% of core operating profit and 0.53% of average advances. During the quarter we made contingency provisions of 10.25 billion Rupees on a prudent basis. The Bank continues to carry Covid- 19 related provision of 64.25 billion Rupees as contingency provisions at March 31, 2022. Thus, the Bank holds contingency provision of 74.50 billion Rupees as of March 31, 2022. The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 79.2%.

D. Growth in digital offerings  Leveraging digital and technology across businesses is a key element of our strategy of growing the risk calibrated core operating profit. We have seen significant increase in the adoption of our mobile banking app, iMobile Pay. There have been 6.3 million activations of iMobile Pay by non-ICICI Bank account holders as of end-March. The value of transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders in the current quarter was 4.9 times the value of transactions in Q3 of 2022.      Page 10 of 26 The value of credit card spends grew by 77% year-on-year in Q4 of 2022 driven by higher activation rate through digital onboarding of customers, including Amazon Pay credit cards, automated and effective portfolio management to grow spends among existing card customers and diversification through commercial cards. The Bank has issued more than 3 million Amazon Pay credit cards since its launch. The Bank has recently tied up with Emirates Skywards, the award-winning loyalty programme of Emirates and FlyDubai, to launch a range of co-branded credit cards that enable customers to earn reward points on travel, lifestyle and everyday spends.  The value of financial transactions on InstaBIZ grew by about 44% year-on-year in the current quarter. The value of transactions on the supply chain platforms in the current quarter was 2.7 times the value of transactions in Q4 last year.

The amount of 108.08 billion Rupees at March 31, 2022 includes 23.89 billion Rupee of loans under resolution. The sequential decline during the quarter was mainly due to prepayment from a borrower in the construction sector      Page 11 of 26 where resolution had been implemented as per RBI’s Covid resolution framework. The details are given on slide 41 and 42 of the investor presentation.  Other than two accounts one each in power and telecom sectors, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022, we held provisions of 12.32 billion Rupees on the BB and below portfolio compared to 15.75 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021.

The builder portfolio is about 3% of our total loan portfolio. Our portfolio is granular in nature with the larger exposures being to well- established builders and this is also reflected in the sequential increase in the portfolio. About 9.5% of our builder portfolio at March 31, 2022 was either rated BB and below internally or was classified as non-performing, compared to 11% at December 31, 2021.  F.

The profit after tax of ICICI Securities, on a consolidated basis, increased by 3% year-on- year to 3.40 billion Rupees in this quarter from 3.29 billion Rupees in Q4 of last year.  ICICI Bank Canada had a profit after tax of 4.3 million Canadian dollars in this quarter compared to 5.1 million Canadian dollars in Q4 last year and 11.5 million Canadian dollars in Q3 this year. Profit after tax was higher in Q4 last year and Q3 this year due to write- back of provisions. ICICI Bank Canada repatriated CAD 220 million of equity capital to ICICI Bank in Q4 this year.

334	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Mahrukh, on net interest margin, it is difficult to give an outlook. I think in addition to the competitive pricing that you talked about, like you rightly said, it will also be a function of the repo rate movement through the year and the timing of it. So, we do have a reasonable part of our book which is linked to external benchmarks now, like most other banks as well. So like we always say our target would be to try and see how we can maintain our margins, but it will be a function of what is happening in the market. If you look at the current quarter Q4, our margin was about 4%. If you look at it in the past years also, Q4 traditionally for us has seen margins to be about eight to ten basis points higher just because of the fact that the quarter has lesser number of days, so the annualised computation gives a slightly higher margin. On the core basis, I would say, between Q3 and Q4, the margin was kind of flat and you also saw the fact that the cost of deposits were kind of now bottomed out at 3.47%, 3.48%. So, we will have to kind of navigate through this period before the repo rate starts to increase. And then thereafter definitely the existing book yields will go up, but the incremental lending rates will still be a function of how much liquidity surplus continues in the system.	1308		2	47%, 3.

As far as we are concerned, we have read through the guidelines. We are looking at it more finely, but at the first reading, we will be quite unimpacted by these guidelines. These guidelines seem to be on co-brand, but there are various aspects of co-brand, particularly data sharing and revenue sharing and all of it. So we will be unaffected largely by this circular. But, we are also going through it with toothcomb if there are any issues, but prima facie, it doesn't seem to have any impact. Of course, there is another bucket of customers on activation after one year and if somebody requests for deactivation within seven days, we have to deactivate. I think those are very-very good customer service measures that are coming.      Page 15 of 26 So I would put it into two buckets - co-brand and customer service-related issues.

350	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Firstly, as I had mentioned earlier to Mahrukh's question, we have read through the guidelines, there doesn't seem to be any impact on us prime facie. We will of course go through the guidelines more closely to see if there is any impact. So that will cover the data and all other aspects that you sort of asked about. I think the other important question that you asked is that now is there restrictions on co-brand, will NBFCs be allowed to issue their own cards, etc., I think it seems that it points more towards other fintechs rather than an NBFC/bank type of tie-up, it looks more fintech than other things. So from that perspective, I will say that competitive intensity might come down instead of up from Bank’s perspective. There are a lot more guidelines around customer service and being fair to the customer, which I think are very positive. So that is also positive to us. Will other NBFCs try to get a card? There was an old guideline of RBI where RBI could have given a permission or approval to issue a card, but you have to have an issuing Bank and which is not co-branded. But nobody has launched, but I'm sure many people might be open to launching those things. We will have to see. But the large players who might be open to launching such a thing, they already had co-branded cards in one way or the other. So let us see how it evolves. But overall at this point of time, for our co-branded, there doesn't seem to be much impact or in fact any impact from the first reading. Second, on the competitive intensity, I think it is going to be less than equal to, doesn't seem to be greater than equal to of the larger players coming and issuing or having their own credit card, that was always an option, but has not fructified, it might happen, it is good. But, it's a large market today. So increased competition, etc., we have to basically play our own games. Competitive intensity does impact, but at the end of it finally we will have to play our game well, only then we'll win.

If you can share more color on it the context of contingent provisioning, the provisioning is almost negligible for the quarter. What sort of growth opportunities are we looking at in the wholesale business as growth trends over there have been quite modest and especially in context to the trends being reported by a peer bank.	acquisitions decline increase underperformed there fall grow clear negative stabilizing here sales interested show reported improving continue figures mixed good said comments zero correct adjustments progress customers contribute growing negligible sold positive outperformed unclear	acquisitions increase missing underperformed there fall grow changed clear negative stabilizing here around money improving today continue mixed opportunities good saying said improve comments revenue right correct yes progress contribute comment not outperformed unclear positive over
357	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Maybe I'll talk about the provisions first. So as you said, for us this quarter largely the provisions were the contingent provisions that we made of Rs.10.25 billion. On the rest of the NPA and the restructured book, the provisions were negligible. That reflected, one, the net deletion in NPAs that we had during the quarter. It also reflected the prepayment of a corporate restructured loan that we talked about, that would have resulted in write-back on the provisions that we held for that restructured loan. And we have continued to recover well on both the corporate side and of course on the retail side as well, especially on the retail side the high level of addition that we have seen in the last four to five quarters, those recoveries have been coming in. So, I don't think we should be extrapolating this      Page 20 of 26 quarter from a go forward perspective. I think in the past we have talked about the fact that we would always want our provisions as a percentage of core operating profit, not to exceed 25%. That is of course through a cycle and it will vary up and down depending on the stage of cycle where we are and also the composition of the portfolio. So no specific guidance that we can give there in addition to what we have already said. On the wholesale banking opportunities, I think the good thing is that we get to look at pretty much all the deals that are happening in the market and wherever it is franchise business which is adding to our overall core operating profit, we are happy to do that business. Wherever it is standalone lending opportunities at very fine pricing where the only objective could be book growth and does not really contribute to the core operating profit, we are very happy to stay away from that. And to some extent that is what is reflected in the loan growth for us. As we have said in the earlier calls, I think the entire corporate banking team is also focused on the ecosystem approach towards business. So we don't look at just the loans, we look at all other important services for the corporate client, we look at all that we can do with the employees of the corporate in terms of our retail businesses as well as the dealers and vendors from an SME perspective, and we track the profitability in absolute terms and the ROE for the corporate client as well as for the entire ecosystem. So that is the approach that we have and we will continue with that. We will be competitive wherever required from a franchise perspective. That's how we look at the market. And opportunity is there in terms of growth, and as long as it comes within our risk and return parameters, we are happy to grow.	2663		2	 It also reflected the prepayment of a corporate restructured loan that we talked about, that would have resulted in write-back on the provisions that we held for that restructured loan.

358	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Third question was that what happens to the non-ICICI Bank customers. First, I think we should start to really look at it from a point of view that who are our customers and we will have to start to expand our way of how we think about our customers. We would think that it is not just deposit customers or asset customers who are our customers. Anybody who is using our services becomes our customers. So if it is iMobile Pay, they may not have deposits with us today, they may not have assets with us today but if they start using iMobile Pay, they become our customers. Similarly, FASTag for example. There are many FASTag customers, they are all good customers, they are all affluent customers. They may not have deposits with us and they may not have assets with us, but they are also our customers. So I would say that non-deposit customers and not a non-asset customer because that today is one of the largest flows of good quality leads for a Bank like us, and      Page 21 of 26 our experience with that is very, very good because they tie-in to the brand, they get to see and experience adjunct services that we provide and more data footprint they leave with us, better is our ability to pre-approve them, better is our ability to understand them, and better is our ability in a sharp focused manner to give them propositions that will give them a reason to start overall 360 banking with ICICI Bank. So our experience is good and I thought I'll just expand it a little bit to just share with you what is our general approach to the so-called non-ICICI Bank customers, they are all ICICI Bank customers, they are service customers, they are not deposit customers, they are not asset customers. Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Sameer Bhise from JM Financial.

That view would be taken in the HTM book per se. The AFS and trading book is very actively managed and traded by the trading group. If you look at the current quarter on treasury, I don't think on fixed income side, we would have made money or any other bank would have, given how the yields have moved. For us it would reflect more in FX and other revenues.	546		1	We don't share the duration separately, but again our approach has never been to take high duration into the AFS portfolio even if we have some strong view on interest rates going down.

362	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  So we certainly see that the spends are slowly increasing. As you know, in credit card, it is you get a customer, then they activate, and then they start spending and then they start revolving and there are many facets of this life cycle and you have a fee somewhere and you have interest rate somewhere and all of it. So, we are certainly seeing consumption coming up as Covid-19 normalises and it has normalised quite a bit, almost fully. So we are seeing now spends coming up and revolve also slowly, slowly moving up and that will make all other downstream things which is revolve and fees and all of it should start to look healthier.	641		2	 So we are seeing now spends coming up and revolve also slowly, slowly moving up and that will make all other downstream things which is revolve and fees and all of it should start to look healthier.

So that is a very happy thing for us and that was the desired outcome as well from us and we are seeing is that across categories now spends are increasing and it is evident through other part of ours as our MD also shared with you on the Ultra High Frequency index also. If you look at the components of the index, you will see economic activity everywhere. And finally, this economic activity only reflects in the card spends and on the commercial spends. So, so far so good. Let's see. Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Anand Dama from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. Anand Dama:  My first question is that we have been focusing a lot on the core profitability growth. This quarter we have clocked somewhere about 19%-odd core profitability growth. Now, moving into FY'23 where margin expansion will be a challenge, so what could be the levers of core profitability growth that you can talk about that will be great?

365	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  From operating profit perspective, I think the margins that you talked about, that is of course a prime driver. In addition to that, in terms of the fee income, the business sourcing cost and the other expenses, we look at all the levers and we have to manage all those levers optimally to get the desired outcome on the core operating profit. You are right, that this year we have seen increase in our margin by close to 25 to 30 basis points on a y-o-y basis which has definitely helped us in the strong core operating profit growth. And as I said, we will have to navigate through this coming here especially with the interest rate scenario also changing and we will do the best that we can do in terms of optimising on all these levers and continuing to focus on doing granular good quality business as we do this. Anand Dama:  So, do you think that the fee income actually can improve from here on and what could be the levers for improvement in the fee?	961		2	 In addition to that, in terms of the fee income, the business sourcing cost and the other expenses, we look at all the levers and we have to manage all those levers optimally to get the desired outcome on the core operating profit.

366	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  So the way we look at is not fee income say in aggregate, so as Anup also earlier mentioned, I think it's all about the focus on the micro markets and customers. We don't target an overall fee income growth or something like that. What we are focused is to look at the customer level, the ecosystem level, the micro market, what we can do and if margins are higher, lower fees is fine, or if margins are low, we would need to look at more fees. So it is something which optimally each of the business teams looks at on what needs to be done from the point of view of what works the best and the most fair for both the customer and the Bank. So in aggregate, it is not something that we are focused on and there can always be ups and downs in some of these metrics going forward as well. Anand Dama:  Sir, next year and maybe over next two to three years, there is a peer Bank which is going to look at deposit mobilisation to the extent of about 5 trillion or so. Deposit mobilisation is an area where there is going to be a lot of competition. So how do you see basically in terms of your branch expansion, customer acquisition and deposit rates going forward?

367	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  At any point of time, it is a competitive market on deposits, on lending and we don't see that changing over the next two or three years. So I think there is a certain approach that we have in terms of our liability franchise and the growth that we look at and then how we deploy those funds. So I think we will continue with our approach. Again, in terms of number of branches and all of those things, they are decided by the respective businesses in terms of what they are seeing on the ground in their respective micro market and if they believe addition of branches, addition of people, will help them grow their deposits and more importantly the core operating profit, then they're absolutely happy to go ahead and invest. That is how we look at it. And if there is more competition, I guess we will have to just live with that and see what best we can do.

As long as we are seeing opportunity in the micro market for us to grow, we will be happy to add branches, and, of course, the type of branches have also evolved a lot, so, there are various format branches. So branch is not the only thing, it's an important thing, we will definitely look at adding branches, but it's not just as a reaction to any competitor that we look at it.

A Parasrampuria: Couple of questions. First is we are firmly like a benign credit cost cycle including what you see with your results in the last six months.

370	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Adarsh, I think we'll have to see that over a slightly longer period. Clearly, our focus has been on what we call as return of capital in all our lending and that should result in lower credit costs for us through cycle. But, it is just too early to kind of talk about that. And, of course, in the last couple of quarters like you mentioned, we have also had the benefit of significant deletions, upgrades from NPAs coming because of the larger additions that we have had in the earlier periods because of the C0vid-19. But overall portfolio, definitely, if you look at the rating profile on the corporate SME side which we disclose every quarter, you look at the retail portfolio how the NPA additions there have been moving, it does give us a good amount of confidence but we don't want to kind of right now talk about how low or high these numbers could be. Our approach would always be to see how we can have it at an optimal level from a growth perspective. A Parasrampuria: Anup, you did mention. When we look at how much the retail products have penetrated within our customer base, it's still not optimum and there's a lot of leeway.

371	\icici\mar-22.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  Two things we have certainly strengthened over a period of time. I think over a period of time, last three, four, five years there is more and more and more digital footprint that the      Page 26 of 26 customers have kept with us, because of our very strong digital property. So that helps us also in understanding them better and also figuring out from various other public sources, CIBIL and other places and of course auto debit on deposit, where are they banking with and then we have to give them a very strong reason why they should shift to our Bank and Bank with us in a more holistic manner. The onus is certainly on us. That is one. So there itself saturation, it's okay, but we can certainly make it better. The second place is at the micro market level itself, we have a reasonable sense of what is the profit pool in a micro market given the kind of business that is happening, given the kind of economic activities that underpins the micro market and generally a reasonable idea, I'll not say it is exact, but a reasonable idea of what is our percentage share of that profit pool that is there, there we use. So in both cases we use very, very extreme and very good quality focus on outcome, focus on data analytics. So we have got a good share there and there we see that there are many micro markers, we are quite underpenetrated. And so it is our endeavor to put the processes, put the proposition, reach out to the customer and try and crunch the timeline from the opportunity to conversion. That is really the big job every day full teams are focused on. So these are the two clear opportunities; one, customers who are with us; second, customers who are not with us, but in the micro markets.

372	\icici\mar-23.pdf	Anindya and Abhinek. 	  The Indian economy has continued to show resilience amidst a volatile global environment. The underlying growth momentum is visible in increasing steel and cement output, GST collections, capacity utilisations, rising demand for electricity and travel. The Government led capex cycle is continuing. Financial stability has been maintained and inflation, though elevated, has moderated from its peak. We will continue to monitor these developments closely.  Our strategic focus is growing our risk calibrated core operating profit through the 360- degree customer centric approach and by serving opportunities across customer segments and ecosystems. We continue to operate within our strategic framework and strengthen our franchise, enhance our delivery and servicing capabilities and expand our technology and digital offerings.  The core operating profit increased by 36.4% year-on-year to 138.66 billion Rupees in this quarter and increased by 28.1% year-on-year to 491.39 billion Rupees in FY2023. Core operating profit less provisions grew by 34.7% year-on-year to 122.47 billion Rupees in this quarter and increased by 43.0% year-on-year to 424.73 billion Rupees in FY2023. The profit after tax grew by 30.0% year-on-year to 91.22 billion Rupees in this quarter. For the fiscal year 2023, the profit after tax grew by 36.7% year-on-year to 318.96 billion Rupees. The Board has recommended a dividend of 8 Rupees per share for FY2023, subject to requisite approvals.  Total deposits grew by 10.9% year-on-year and 5.2% sequentially at March 31, 2023. Term deposits increased by 17.1% year-on-year and 4.3% sequentially at March 31, 2023. During the quarter, the average current and savings account deposits grew by 8.0% year-on-year and 1.2% sequentially. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was about 124%.  The retail loan portfolio grew by 22.7% year-on-year and 5.4% sequentially at March 31, 2023. Including non-fund based outstanding, the retail portfolio was 45.7% of the total portfolio. The business banking portfolio grew by 34.9% year-on-year and 7.8% sequentially. The SME portfolio grew by 19.2% year-on-year and 6.2% sequentially. The growth in SME and business banking portfolios was driven by leveraging our branch network and digital offerings such as InstaBIZ and Merchant Stack. The domestic   Page 3 of 18  corporate portfolio grew by 21.2% year-on-year and 3.8% sequentially at March 31, 2023 driven by growth across well-rated financial and non-financial corporates. The rural portfolio grew by 13.8% year-on-year and 5.5% sequentially. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 20.5% year-on-year and 5.0% sequentially. The overall loan portfolio grew by 18.7% year-on-year and 4.7% sequentially at March 31, 2023.  We continue to enhance our digital offerings and platforms to onboard new customers in a seamless manner, provide them end-to-end digital journeys and personalised solutions and enable a more effective data driven cross sell and up sell. We have shared some details on our technology and digital offerings in slides 17 to 28 of the investor presentation.  The net NPA ratio declined to 0.48% at March 31, 2023 from 0.55% at December 31, 2022 and 0.76% at March 31, 2022. During the quarter, there were net additions of 0.14 billion Rupees to gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale. The provisioning coverage ratio on NPAs was 82.8% at March 31, 2023. The total provisions during the quarter were 16.19 billion Rupees or 11.7% of core operating profit and 0.7% of average advances. This includes contingency provision of 16.00 billion Rupees made on a prudent basis. The Bank holds contingency provisions of 131.00 billion Rupees or about 1.3% of total loans as of March 31, 2023.  The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.12%, Tier 1 ratio of 17.60% and total capital adequacy ratio of 18.34% at March 31, 2023, after reckoning the impact of proposed dividend.  Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to drive growth in the risk calibrated core operating profit. We believe our focus on customer 360, extensive franchise and synergy and collaboration within the organization, backed by our digital offerings and process improvement and service delivery initiatives will enable us to deliver customized solutions to customers in a seamless manner and grow market share across key segments. We will continue to make investments in technology, people, distribution and building our brand. We will remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with prudent provisioning and healthy levels of capital. The principles of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank” and “One Bank, One Team, One RoE” will continue to guide our operations.

The balance 31% of loans have fixed interest rates. The cost of deposits was 3.98% in this quarter compared to 3.65% in the previous quarter.

375	\icici\mar-23.pdf	Mahrukh Adajania 	  My first question is on outlook for margins. So obviously, the margin achievement for FY2023 has been phenomenal. But, would you have a threshold below which you think margins won't fall, because obviously margins are peakish for the sector, so could you give us a band in which you would like to hold margins even if they are not sustainable at these levels? 	362		2	 So obviously, the margin achievement for FY2023 has been phenomenal.

376	\icici\mar-23.pdf	Anindya Banerjee 	  I don't think that we can really give a band. Our efforts, first of all, would be to continue to grow our liability franchise in a healthy way across optimizing quantum and cost, because that is really the starting point and then price our lending in an appropriate fashion, while, of course, looking at the entire ecosystem and customer level profitability, and also manage interest rate risk and earnings which is on the balance sheet as best we can, while having to work with the fact that the requirement of pricing, a large part of the lending to external benchmarks, that creates this cyclicality and then we will see where we emerge out of it. Our endeavour, of course, would be to protect our operating profitability as far as we can. 	745		1	 Our endeavour, of course, would be to protect our operating profitability as far as we can.

Our yield on investments has also gone up as we have our increased government bond portfolio at higher yields and we've also seen a repricing of our floating rate bond portfolio. At the same time, the deposit costs have also started to reflect the higher rates at which deposits are being raised incrementally. So, I think, we would believe that the NIMs are at kind of peak or near peak levels. And from here, we should see a moderation. Of course, it's difficult to give a very precise outlook on that.

I think when we really adopted operating profit as the main operative metric for us, we were making significant provision on our historic NPL book. And now, if we look at it, that is largely addressed. And given the kind of provisioning policies that we have now, where there is very little lag between an asset turning delinquent or over 90 days and getting provided for,  the operating profit less provisions is a pretty accurate reflector of the earnings of the business or the growth and quality of the business. So that's one thing to keep in mind. Of course, as you know and as we discussed in the past, the kind of margin expansion that we have seen this year, will not be there next year and there will be some pressure on margins. But that, will hopefully get addressed along with growth.

But those are quite moderate and the maturity out of the past years’ RIDF portfolio has exceeded that.  Moderator:  We'll take a last question for today from MB Mahesh from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.  MB Mahesh:  Just two questions. One, when you look at the mortgage part of the book, could you just tell us how have you kind of worked through the borrowers with respect to the increasing interest rates? 	550		1	We have some shortfalls in a couple of the subcategories.

420	\icici\mar-23.pdf	Anindya Banerjee 	  The standard structure of floating rate home loans in India is that, when the interest rate rises, the tenure gets extended subject to certain cut offs, which could be in terms of age or certain criteria that are defined for the various customers. And, similarly, when the interest rates decline, tenure gets shorter, and customers also understand the cycle pretty well. So, in the current cycle, of course, given the sharp increase in the benchmark   Page 17 of 18  rates over a relatively short period, a fairly large part of the portfolio would have seen an EMI increase, but that has happened.  MB Mahesh:  If you look at the increase in the CASA ratio, growth slowdown reflect anything about the underlying customer profile, in the sense that are you seeing salary credits or savings credits kind of significantly slowing down for rural in the portfolio, as a consequence of it, you should see a slowdown in the sector quite soon? 	938		0	The standard structure of floating rate home loans in India is that, when the interest rate rises, the tenure gets extended subject to certain cut offs, which could be in terms of age or certain criteria that are defined for the various customers.

421	\icici\mar-23.pdf	Anindya Banerjee 	  No, I don't think so. I think what has happened is that we had two years of extremely strong growth and probably this is the year when our segment of customers have seen a consumption recovery and so on. The second is, of course, as interest rates go up you will see some shift from SA to FD. Those seem to be two main factors - the base effect and rise in interest rates on the savings account side. On the current account side, actually, when we look at the average growth, it has been a little bit better. Although, again the circumstances in terms of tight liquidity and so on are not that conducive to current account growth, but we have been able to offset some of that with the digital propositions and getting more flow through the Bank.

Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to ICICI Bank Q2-2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal for an operator by pressing ‘*’ then ‘0’ on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Bakhshi -- Managing Director and CEO of ICICI Bank. Thank you. And over to you, sir.     ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 2 of 32 Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks  Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the results for Q2 of FY2022. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh and Anindya.  We hope that you are safe and in good health. India has witnessed a steady decline in Covid-19 cases and a massive pickup in the vaccination programme since June. India has now crossed the milestone of administering 100 crore vaccination doses. We would like to extend our gratitude to the efforts and dedication of all health workers and essential service providers for their untiring efforts in the recovery from the pandemic. I would also like to take a moment to thank our employees for their service to customers in these challenging times. We are happy to share that now almost all our employees have received at least one dose of the vaccine.  Economic activity has continued to improve since June. The Ultra Frequency Index, comprising several high frequency indicators tracked by the Bank’s Economic Research Group, has steadily increased from 99.6 in the first week of July 2021 to 105.5 in September 2021 and reached 110.3 in the week ending October 17. The underlying economic activity continues to show an upward momentum owing to higher peak power demand, e-way bill generation and rail freight revenues, improved vehicle registrations on the back of the festive season, and rising labour force participation rate in urban areas. Overall industrial activity is above pre Covid-19 levels. The progress in the vaccination programme is supporting an improvement in mobility indicators. We expect the festive season to give further impetus to economic activity.  During the challenging period of the last 18 months, we at ICICI Bank have continued to strengthen our franchise and delivery and servicing capabilities, with a range of digital initiatives. Our loan portfolio has performed well in the face of the challenges posed by the two waves of the pandemic, behaving either in line with or better than our expectations. We aim to create holistic value propositions for our customers through our 360-degree customer-centric approach and focus on opportunities across client and segment ecosystems. Cross-functional teams have been created to tap into key customer and market segments, enabling 360-degree coverage of customers and increase in wallet   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 3 of 32 share. We will continue to steadily grow our business and franchise within our strategic framework.  Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:   1. Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the focused pursuit of target market segments  The core operating profit increased by 23.3% year-on-year and 10.6% sequentially to 95.18 billion Rupees in this quarter. The profit after tax grew by 29.6% year-on-year and 19.4% sequentially to 55.11 billion Rupees in this quarter.  2. Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise  Growth in deposits continued to be strong at 17.3% year-on-year at September 30, 2021. During the quarter, average current account deposits increased by 35.7% year- on-year and average savings account deposits by 24.9% year-on-year. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was 133%, reflecting continued surplus liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system.  3. Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward  The retail loan portfolio grew by 20.0% year-on-year and 5.0% sequentially at September 30, 2021. With the increase in economic activity, disbursements across all retail products increased sequentially in this quarter. Mortgage disbursements were close to the level seen in Q4 of 2021, reflecting the increase in demand coupled with our seamless customer onboarding experience through pre-approved offers and digitisation. Disbursements of personal loans and auto loans were also close to Q4 of 2021 levels. Credit cards in force increased by 6.0% sequentially and the value of credit card spends grew by 47.0% sequentially. Spends across most categories other than travel crossed March 2021 levels in September. We expect the momentum in spends to continue in the festive season.    ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 4 of 32 The business banking and SME portfolios grew by 43.1% year-on-year and 42.0% year-on-year respectively. Sequentially, the business banking portfolio grew by 12.3% and the SME portfolio grew by 11.3%. We are observing a steady uptick in the number of credit enquiries and with our digital offerings and platforms like InstaBIZ, Merchant Stack and Trade Online, we believe that there is significant potential for growth across these portfolios.  Excluding the builder portfolio, the growth in the domestic corporate portfolio was about 14% year-on-year at September 30, 2021.  Overall, the domestic loan portfolio grew by 19.0% year-on-year and 4.0% sequentially.   4. Leveraging digital across our business  Our digital platforms are continuously evolving to enable best-in-class end-to-end seamless digital journeys, offer personalized solutions and value added features to customers and enable more effective data-driven cross-sell and up-sell. These platforms also enable us to acquire new customers. We have shared some details in slides 18 to 30 of the investor presentation.  We have seen significant increase in adoption of our mobile banking app, iMobile Pay. There were about 1.5 million activations from non-ICICI Bank account holders in the current quarter, taking the total activations to 4 million as of end-September. The transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders in terms of value and volume respectively were three times and thirteen times higher in September 2021 compared to June 2021. We are seeing a rapid rise in payment transactions through repeat use of features such as ‘Pay to Contact’ and ‘Scan to Pay’.  We continue to expand the suite of services offered through iMobile Pay to achieve high engagement levels with users. Recently, we launched a facility which enables our savings account holders to manage dues of credit cards of any bank through iMobile Pay. We also launched a contactless payment facility on iMobile Pay which   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 5 of 32 enables users of android based smartphones to make credit and debit card payments on POS terminals in a safe and secure manner by tapping their phones.  The financial transactions on our digital platform for businesses, InstaBIZ, and our supply chain platforms have grown steadily in the past few quarters. The value of financial transactions on InstaBIZ grew by about 80% year-on-year in Q2 of 2022. We have onboarded about 200 corporate customers on our supply chain platforms. About 70% of the dealers of these customers are active on our supply chain platforms. The value of transactions through these platforms increased 4.7 times year- on-year in Q2 of 2022.  The proportion of end-to-end digital sanctions and disbursements across various products has been increasing steadily. About 32% of our mortgage sanctions and 40% of our personal loan disbursements, by volume, were end-to-end digital in H1 of 2022. About 95% of the overdraft facilities set up for business banking current account customers were end-to-end digital in H1 of 2022. 40% of asset and liability accounts opened during the quarter were through digital channels.  An important element of our strategy to grow our risk-calibrated core operating profit is to serve the complete financial requirements of customers and their ecosystems. The ICICI STACK for corporates is being continuously enhanced. We have created 19 industry specific STACKs which provide bespoke and purpose-based digital solutions to corporate clients and their ecosystems. The volume of transactions through these solutions grew 2.4 times year-on-year in Q2 of 2022. These solutions along with the depth of our coverage have supported the strong growth in our average current account deposits. Further, the Bank is well positioned to capture the opportunities arising from the growing FDI and capital market flows.  We are focusing holistically on the merchant ecosystem, both directly and through partnerships. Our Super Merchant current account which offers various benefits such as digital account opening and instant overdraft facilities based on point-of-sale transactions has been receiving a good response from customers. We have partnered with Amazon India to offer instant overdraft to sellers, including non-ICICI Bank customers, on its portal. We have also launched an instant overdraft facility for   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 6 of 32 MSMEs registered on the GEM Sahay application through API integration with the OCEN network.  5. Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks  Net NPAs declined by 12.3% sequentially to 81.61 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021 from 93.06 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021. The net NPA ratio declined to 0.99% at September 30, 2021 from 1.16% at June 30, 2021. The net additions to gross NPAs during the quarter were 0.96 billion Rupees. The total provisions during the quarter were 27.14 billion Rupees or 28.5% of core operating profit and 1.44% of average advances. The provision coverage ratio on NPAs was 80.1% at September 30, 2021. The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers under resolution as per various guidelines was 96.84 billion Rupees or about 1.3% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021. The Bank holds provisions of 19.50 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines. In addition, the Bank continues to hold Covid-19 provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees or about 0.8% of total loans as of September 30, 2021.  6. Maintaining a strong capital base  The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.33% at September 30, 2021, including profits for H1 of 2022. Further, the market value of the Bank’s investments in listed entities of the Group is about 1 trillion Rupees.  Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to grow our core operating profit in a risk calibrated manner. Using ICICI STACK, we will create digital journeys and offer personalized and customized solutions to the customers to suit their life-stage and business needs. We will continue to build flexibility and agility in the Bank to tap into opportunities across ecosystems. We believe that our ongoing investments in technology, people and distribution network, our prudent risk management practices and our strong balance sheet will enable us to drive growth in our core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner. We continue to be guided by our philosophy of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank”, emphasising the need to deliver fair value to customers while creating value for   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 7 of 32 shareholders. We will continue to focus on delivering consistent and predictable returns to our shareholders.

I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, capital adequacy, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.  A. Balance sheet growth  The overall loan portfolio grew by 17.2% year-on-year and 3.6% sequentially at September 30, 2021. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 19.0% year-on-year and 4.0% sequentially at September 30, 2021. The retail portfolio grew by 20.0% year-on-year and 5.0% sequentially. Within the retail portfolio, the mortgage loan portfolio grew by 25.0% year- on-year, and rural loans and auto loans by 16.1% each. The commercial vehicles and equipment portfolio declined by 5.0% year-on-year. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 20.7% year-on-year. This portfolio was 724.16 billion Rupees or 9.5% of the overall loan book at September 30, 2021.  The business banking portfolio grew by 43.1% year-on-year and 12.3% sequentially at September 30, 2021. The SME business, comprising borrowers with a turnover of less than 2.5 billion Rupees, grew by 42.0% year-on-year and increased by 11.3% sequentially.  The growth of the domestic corporate portfolio was 11.5% year-on-year. Excluding the builder portfolio, the growth was about 14% year-on-year, driven by disbursements to higher rated corporates and PSUs across various sectors to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We are focusing on providing the full suite of banking products to corporate clients and their ecosystems.  The overseas loan portfolio declined by 8.6% year-on-year and 3.5% sequentially at September 30, 2021. The overseas loan portfolio was 5.1% of the overall loan book at September 30, 2021. The non-India linked corporate portfolio reduced by 56.9% or about   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 8 of 32 1.1 billion US Dollars year-on-year and 15.9% or about 154 million US Dollars sequentially, at September 30, 2021. We have provided the breakup of our overseas corporate portfolio on slide 16 of the investor presentation. Coming to the funding side: average savings account deposits increased by 24.9% year- on-year and 4.3% sequentially. Average current account deposits increased by 35.7% year-on-year 4.6% sequentially. Total term deposits grew by 12.5% year-on-year to 5.3 trillion Rupees at September 30, 2021.  B. Credit quality  Net NPAs declined by about 12.3% sequentially to 81.61 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021 from 93.06 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021. The net NPA ratio decreased to 0.99% at September 30, 2021 from 1.16% at June 30, 2021.  The net additions to gross NPA were 0.96 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 36.04 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There were net deletions of 5.54 billion Rupees from gross NPAs in the retail and business banking portfolios and net additions of 6.50 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the corporate and SME portfolios.  The gross NPA additions declined to 55.78 billion Rupees in the current quarter from 72.31 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The gross NPA additions from the retail and business banking portfolio were 46.24 billion Rupees and from the corporate and SME portfolio were 9.54 billion Rupees. The gross NPA additions from the corporate and SME portfolio were almost entirely from borrowers rated BB and below as of June 30, 2021, and devolvement of non-fund based outstanding to NPAs.  Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, increased to 54.82 billion Rupees from 36.27 billion rupees in the previous quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 51.78 billion Rupees from the retail and business banking portfolio and 3.04 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The recoveries and upgrades in the current quarter include upgrades of 11.67 billion Rupees where resolution was implemented as per RBI’s framework. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 17.17 billion Rupees. The Bank sold gross NPAs amounting to 0.90 billion Rupees in Q2 of 2022 on a cash basis.   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 9 of 32 The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 37.14 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2021 compared to 41.01 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 17.71 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2021 on this non-fund based outstanding.  The outstanding to all borrowers where resolution was implemented as per Covid-19 framework 2.0 was 41.58 billion Rupees. The outstanding to borrowers where resolution was implemented as per Covid-19 framework 1.0 and later modified as per Covid-19 framework 2.0 was 1.18 billion Rupees. The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers, under resolution as per various guidelines was 96.84 billion Rupees or about 1.3% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021 compared to 48.64 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021. Of the total fund based outstanding under resolution at September 30, 2021, 69.92 billion Rupees was from the retail and business banking portfolio and 26.92 billion Rupees was from the corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 19.50 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines. Over 95% of the loans under resolution in the retail and business banking portfolio are secured loans.  Till the last quarter, we disclosed the rating-wise breakup of the total loan book wherein the retail loan portfolios were grouped under various categories at the product level. Based on feedback received, from this quarter we have disclosed the rating-wise details of the non-retail portfolio comprising domestic corporate, SME, business banking and overseas advances in order to provide a more transparent presentation of the rated portfolio. The details are given on slide 38 of the investor presentation.  The proportion of overdues across most products in the performing retail, SME and business banking portfolio as of September 30, 2021 has reduced compared to June 30, 2021 and has reached March 2021 levels. Less than 1% of the performing corporate portfolio is overdue as of September 30, 2021.        ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 10 of 32 C. P&L Details  Net interest income increased by 24.8% year-on-year to 116.90 billion Rupees. Interest on income tax refund was 0.30 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 0.14 billion Rupees in the previous quarter and 0.26 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year. The net interest margin was at 4.00% in this quarter compared to 3.89% in the previous quarter and 3.57% in Q2 of last year. The domestic NIM was at 4.09% this quarter compared to 3.99% in Q1 and 3.72% in Q2 last year. International margins were at 0.26%. The cost of deposits was 3.53% in Q2 compared to 3.65% in Q1. The sequential increase in NIM in this quarter was primarily due to decline in cost of funds and lower interest reversals on NPAs.  Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 26.2% year-on-year to 44.00 billion Rupees in Q2 of 2022   Fee income increased by 21.4% year-on-year to 38.11 billion Rupees in Q2. Fees from retail, business banking and SME customers grew by 24.6% year-on-year and constituted about 77.9% of the total fees in this quarter.  Dividend income from subsidiaries and listed entities was 5.83 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 3.34 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year. The dividend income this quarter includes final dividend of ICICI General and higher final dividend from ICICI Securities compared to Q2 of last year.  On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 28.0% year-on-year in Q2 reflecting the low base of Q2 last year. The employee expenses increased by 21.2% year- on-year. The Bank had slightly over 100,000 employees at September 30, 2021. The employee count has increased by about 8,000 in the last 12 months. Employee expenses in Q2 include an impact of about 1.25 billion Rupees due to fair valuation of ESOPs granted to all employees post April 1, 2021 for the current and previous quarter as required by RBI guidelines. Non-employee expenses increased by 32.3% year-on-year in this quarter primarily due to retail business and technology related expenses. We will continue to invest in technology, people, distribution and building our brand.  The core operating profit increased by 23.3% year-on-year and 10.6% sequentially to 95.18 billion Rupees in this quarter.   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 11 of 32 There was a treasury gain of 3.97 billion Rupees in Q2 compared to 2.90 billion Rupees in Q1 and 5.42 billion Rupees in Q2 of the previous year.  The total provisions during the quarter were 27.14 billion Rupees or 28.5% of core operating profit and 1.44% of average advances. There was no writeback of Covid-19 related provisions during the quarter. The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 80.1% as of September 30, 2021. In addition, we hold 19.50 billion Rupees of provisions on borrowers under resolution and Covid-19 related provisions of 64.25 billion Rupees. The Covid-19 provisions are about 0.8% of loans. At September 30, 2021, the total provisions, other than specific provisions on NPAs, were 149.51 billion Rupees or 2.0% of loans. Given the performance of the portfolio, we are confident that these provisions will completely cushion the balance sheet from the potential credit losses which may arise due to the pandemic.  The profit before tax grew by 36.7% year-on-year to 72.01 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 52.66 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year. The tax expense was 16.90 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 10.15 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit after tax grew by 29.6% year-on-year to 55.11 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 42.51 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year.  In accordance with the Scheme of Arrangement between ICICI General and Bharti AXA General Insurance, assets and liabilities of Bharti AXA’s general insurance business vested with ICICI General on the appointed date of April 1, 2020. The Bank’s consolidated financial statements for Q1 of 2022 have been restated to reflect the scheme and there was no material impact on the consolidated profit after tax. The consolidated profit after tax was 60.92 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 48.82 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year.  D. Capital  The CET1 ratio, including profits for H1 of 2022, was 17.33% at September 30, 2021 compared to 17.01% at June 30, 2021. The Tier 1 ratio was 18.53% and the total capital adequacy ratio was 19.52% at September 30, 2021.     ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 12 of 32 E. Portfolio information  We have been growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward. Our retail portfolio has been built based on proprietary data and analytics in addition to bureau checks, utilising the existing customer database for sourcing in key retail asset products through cross sell and up-sell and pricing in relation to the risk. In the business banking and SME business, our focus is on parameterised and programme based lending, granularity, collateral and robust monitoring. Credit summations in the overdraft accounts of business banking and SME customers have continued to grow consistently in this quarter and reached March 2021 levels in September. We have given further information on our retail and business banking portfolio in slides 37 to 47 of our investor presentation.  The loan and non-fund based outstanding to performing corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and below was 127.14 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021 compared to 139.75 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021 and 119.29 billion Rupees at September 30, 2020. The details are given on slide 39 and 40 of the investor presentation.  Similar to the last quarter, other than three accounts, one each in construction, power and telecom sectors, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021. At September 30, 2021, we held provisions of 9.60 billion Rupees on the BB and below portfolio compared to 9.76 billion Rupees at June 30, 2021.  The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans and working capital loans was 228.14 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021 or 3% of our total loan portfolio. Our portfolio is granular in nature with the larger exposures being to well-established builders.

The profit after tax of ICICI Securities, on a consolidated basis, increased by 26.3% year- on-year to 3.51 billion Rupees in this quarter from 2.78 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year.  ICICI Bank Canada had a profit after tax of 8.4 million Canadian dollars in this quarter compared to 5.1 million Canadian dollars in Q2 last year and 5.0 million Canadian dollars in the previous quarter.

438	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Our focus is on growing the risk calibrated core operating profit. I think loan growth is one of the drivers. Depending on the overall demand, the risk that we perceive, the pricing, we will look at the growth numbers. Clearly there is momentum and you can see that in the sequential growth during the quarter. If you look at business banking, SME, retail, a lot of initiatives that we have taken also on the digital side, on easing the customer onboarding process, the underwriting process, all of that is helping. On the corporate side again, we get to look at all the deals which are there in the market but the market is pricing loans in a certain way given the surplus liquidity. So our focus there, for example, is a lot more on the entire corporate ecosystem and looking at the core operating profit that we can generate and not just the loan growth. So, we would not want to comment on any specific sequential growth numbers. Based on the opportunities which are there for us to increase our operating profit, we will grow.	1033		2	 So our focus there, for example, is a lot more on the entire corporate ecosystem and looking at the core operating profit that we can generate and not just the loan growth.

442	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  It's a very interesting question Prakash. The way we look at it and way we do things is that if you look at the sheer number of customers on the assets side, it will always be lower than the deposits side because in mortgages the ticket size is very large. However, there is another set of customers who are coming on to us who are neither deposit customers nor asset customers. They are essentially payment and service customers like FASTag and iMobile Pay. Our credit card play is another big source. Now, what is happening is that there is a steady inflow of customers we are getting, even non-asset and non-liability customers. They are essentially coming for services which becomes a big source of liabilities for us. You can cross-sell liability accounts to them and then of course customers who are not our customers and have taken assets, we then cross-sell liability products to them. But I must say that the reverse is a lesser number, that is assets to liabilities. Services to liabilities is a very large number, services to assets is a smaller number. Liabilities to asset   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 17 of 32 is a very large number, assets to liabilities is a relatively smaller number because of the ticket sizes. But all of them, as you would appreciate, are interlinked because if one is not there and then if you don't do 360-degree coverage of each of those customers who come in through the door, then it is an opportunity that we would not have captured. So, that's how we think about process.	1525		1	 Now, what is happening is that there is a steady inflow of customers we are getting, even non-asset and non-liability customers.

Many of them are but many of them are also not ICICI Bank deposit customers. It is easier to sell the deposit accounts to them and once they become deposit account holders and we have more digital footprint, then we give them pre-approved offers and then we sell asset products. So, I'm just giving you another dimension.

The other thing that has happened the corporate real estate developer side is that after RERA and various reforms, and the volatility in the last few years, I think it is strengthening and it is consolidating quite well. If you look at market shares of large developers, they have been increasing. That has been our view now since last one year or so and it is consolidating well and we are also consolidating our position there. I think it's the right time to really focus on bank ecosystem and the real estate ecosystem as it's a very large asset class. It's an asset which will perhaps be larger than the full financial asset   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 18 of 32 class. So, there is a lot of opportunity and lot of scope there as well. On mortgages, we have our 360-degree customer coverage strategy firmly in place and there is demand. Of course there is competitive pricing, as you know, because it’s a low loss given default product.

448	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Abhishek, like we have said earlier also, on the retail business one has to look at the net additions also because a lot of the gross additions that you see get recovered or upgraded in the same quarter also. So, of course this quarter the recoveries and upgrades are much higher than usual, partly reflecting the fact that in Q1-2022 we had higher additions to gross NPAs. On an overall basis, the numbers that we have seen in the current quarter on retail, rural, business banking, SME and across portfolios, have pretty much been in line with our expectation. We have pointed out in the past that commercial vehicle is one segment where the stress has been there even prior to the Covid-19 period and over the last 18 months that has kind of continued. Otherwise, across portfolios if you look at the additions and deletions, it has been a reasonably stable trend and the good thing is that the overdues on the portfolio also, which I mentioned earlier, have now come back to the March 2021 level. In June 2021 they had again gotten elevated because of the second wave. So, the overdues have also come down across retail and the business banking portfolio.

454	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  So, last quarter also we had said that we would try and protect our NIM at the level at which it was in Q1-2022 which had seen a sequential increase. This quarter definitely the fact that the net NPL additions are pretty much negligible has helped because interest reversal and all of that is not there. In addition, because of the NPA deletions, you kind of collect interest which was not booked earlier. So, that has helped in the current quarter. If you look at the NIM in H1-2022 which was at about 3.94%, our endeavour will be to protect the margin at those levels. The moving parts are definitely the competitive intensity which is there across all the segments of lending. As you would have seen we have really not been price leaders across any of the products or segments. We would kind of bring down our prices, if required, based on what we are seeing in the market. The cost of deposits has really been something which has helped us in improving our margins even in this quarter. We saw 12 basis point decline in the cost of deposit driven by the 36% year-on- year growth in daily average current account deposits and 25% year-on-year growth in average savings accounts balances. So, these are the variables. Overall of course the interest rates will inch up as RBI kind of normalizes the liquidity in the system. So how the repo rate moves and how the funding cost moves, all of those will be variables which will come into play maybe towards the end of the year or in the first half of next year. We will be focused on pricing our loans appropriately to get the required return. Moderator:  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Aggarwal from Motilal Oswal Securities.

456	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  We have talked about the fact that we look at customer 360 and so we don’t look at just a single product in most of the instances now. When we give out a home loan, we also have the customer opening their savings deposit with us and this is true across all the products. The customer 360 is a very key thing for us and similarly looking at the entire ecosystem, be it a corporate ecosystem or any other ecosystem that we focus on. We look at it on an aggregate basis and the contribution to operating profit again on an aggregate basis. So, you have seen the volumes that we have been able to do on the mortgages in this quarter, both the year-on-year growth and the sequential growth reflect that. So, there are opportunities for growth. We will of course not go completely bottom fishing in terms of the rates which are there. But we have also brought down the headline rates with some of the competition bringing it down. Overall with the cost of funding being where it is, and the fact that the mortgage customers are sticky customers, give us the opportunity to service them across wide range of product and services over a long period of time.

So it’s a clear focus area for us and Anup has talked about it in the past as well. The tie up that we have with Amazon has really worked well for us. In terms of growth again, you have seen the growth that we have seen in the cards in force or the credit cards spends and the market shares have also improved for us. In terms of profitability, it’s not that we have the numbers of all the players in the market so it is difficult to comment in terms of on a comparative basis. But credit card is always a portfolio where the returns have been pretty good. If we look at the experience of the last 18 months through the Covid-19 period, the numbers in terms of NPA additions or credit losses, given the pandemic, have actually clearly been better than what we would have expected. So, those are the trend which are there. Anup, you want to add something?	1074		2	 Credit card is a product which is used frequently by the customer, so you kind of end up getting an opportunity to service the customer on an ongoing basis.

So, overall, that means that it’s not a portfolio where we are overly worried but indeed some of the ECLGS customers would have had relatively higher stress than the rest of the portfolio. So, there could be NPL additions which could be somewhat higher than the rest of the portfolio, but we don’t think that it is going to be anything which is material.

There would be some cases which would still be under implementation at 30th of September as you know these are retail loans and it does take some time for all of that to get implemented. So, there would be some amount of restructuring increase that one will see in Q3. But in the overall context it is not going to be any material number I would say. It will be definitely be less than Rs. 10 billion. That is what is there in terms of the pipeline. On provisions, the RBI requirement was to take about 10% provision on the Covid-19 restructured loans, against that we have taken 15% provision. Some of the loans which have got restructured were NPA and have got upgraded due to restructuring. In those loans we have carried forward the provision which was made when they became NPA, so that’s the reason why we have an overall provision of about 20% on the restructured portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, predominantly the secured portfolio has got restructured so we would expect to recover and collect on these, but it’s something that we will assess on a quarter-on-quarter basis. At any point of time, if we believe there is higher provision requirement we would be happy to make that. One should also consider that we in any case have Rs. 64.25 billion of Covid-19 related provisions as well. If you look at the numbers that we have put out as per the RBI requirement for disclosure, the slippages from the restructuring done last year have not been material in the first half of the year. Of   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 24 of 32 course some of those loans or actually many of those loans would still be under moratorium, like I said earlier, moratorium is anywhere between 6-12 months. So, we will continue to assess this portfolio and if required we will make some more provision. On an overall basis, we are quite comfortable with the provisions at the Bank level and this quarter in any case we have not even utilized or written back any of the Covid-19 provision. Anand Dama:  Sir, that’s very comforting. Second question is about the ICICI PayLater book. There is lot of buzz about BNPL and we are also dominant player in that. Is it possible for you to give some trends in terms of how that book is playing up. ICICI Bank’s Amazon Pay card has done very well, so if you can provide some numbers in terms of your PayLater book?	2566		1	Anand, I didn’t get your second part of the question well, but I’ll answer.

462	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  So, I don’t think we have provided the numbers. The whole spectrum of credit in this space is becoming very interesting. You normally have credit card which is a fantastic and a very flexible instrument. Then of course you have the EMI on credit and debit cards and now BNPL. All of these are also installment products. But the difference between BNPL and other products is that BNPL is essentially driven by merchants and so there is an implicit promise to the merchants that if you give BNPL, their average order value will increase. So the cost to the merchant is higher than sometimes the credit card MDR that we give out and then there is the economics in between. So we have a full spectrum of affordability products of which PayLater also is one of the products and we have credit cards and EMI on debit and credit cards. So, from our perspective, as a bank because we have got the flexibility of instruments and a full spectrum. We would want to certainly be there in all spectrum depending on what customers and merchants want. We should be able to provide them with all the options that they have. The good thing that has happened in the last three years is that the whole merchant ecosystem has become very digital, right from onboarding.  UPI is virtually zero MDR. So, you can have EMI based credit product based on that as well. What has happened is that it has become very digital and so the cost of onboarding has come down. The cost of reconciliation and credit delivery has come down, which is why you will see that this area of merchant ecosystem is exploding in a very big way. Large brands like us have a natural   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 25 of 32 advantage to play that game because we already have a large sort of footprint. We have a large merchant footprint from a current account perspective. We see a lot of flow happening through us and so we can do underwriting and onboarding digitally quite easily. So, actually it’s an interesting space which is unfolding. But BNPL is a form factor of credit delivery and we look at it that way. It’s not a completely new product in the market. It has been there in various shapes and forms. BNPL of course has its own advantages in the sense that it caters to the need of a customer. Customers may not be having credit cards, or they may not be having bureau scores and these underwritings are on the fly, so it’s a good form factor and it’s a good product for many customers. Our PayLater product also is positioned well and the other thing about many of these affordability products is that it is at the place of purchase and you don’t have to go outside to take the loan unlike personal loans, etc. It’s not a new thing exactly, credit card was always there, but in a new way it is coming so the space is interesting. Anand Dama:  So, basically the acceptability among the customers certainly has gone up. So is it to some extent cannibalizing on our low value credit card spends?	2963		2	 So the cost to the merchant is higher than sometimes the credit card MDR that we give out and then there is the economics in between.

463	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Anup Bagchi 	  No, we haven’t seen that as yet. So, from an affordability perspective there are two things, one is that first you have to ascertain the underwriting of the customers. Once the threshold is reached, where there is return of capital is, I will not say assured, but you have a high confidence on return of capital, then the next immediate thing is creating a very decongested and easy process. Because if you have a very difficult process, customers will not take credit, they will take some other route to take credit. So, if one can have a very good onboarding process, a credit delivery, particularly an on the fly credit delivery process and you can take care of the issues of the merchant, that is they get their money and settlement and then you take over the settlement detail by way of postponing cash flows from the consumer and you make that process completely seamless, you can give it any name, you can give it revolver, you can call it BNPL. Everything is BNPL, actually credit card is also BNPL. One has to make sure that it a very good customer experience. Also, from a bureau score perspective, banks have new to credit customers because they   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 26 of 32 have salary accounts. So, the banks can underwrite new to credit customers well and then there is an added advantage that banks have of providing a very decongested on the fly underwriting process and an ability to integrate with the merchant in a very seamless way. So, that’s really the value to the ecosystem that the product and service should offer, given that the demand for credit we have seen. So it gets picked up then. Moderator:  Thank you. The next question is from the line of Shagun Verma from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.	1744		1	 Everything is BNPL, actually credit card is also BNPL.

464	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rahul Jain 	  This is Rahul here. Just two, three questions. One is on the non-employee cost, it has seen a pretty sharp spike this quarter. So, just wanted to understand how do you see that? What’s kind of driving this? I understand business momentum has picked up so that cost may have started coming through, but apart from that is there anything else that we should know? On the digital, technology side how is the spending trending and also these partnerships based spends, for example, The Big Billion Day, etc. So, can you just throw some color on that?	548		1	 I understand business momentum has picked up so that cost may have started coming through, but apart from that is there anything else that we should know.

465	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  Yes, so the employee expenses were up by about 21% on a year-on-year basis. We have seen about 7-8% increase in the number of employees on an average from last Q2 to this Q2 and some increase in the salaries. So all of that along with the ESOP cost that came in this quarter would account for that increase. On the non-employee expenses, there are clearly two sets of categories, the first category which is growing is virtually all linked to business. So that would be of course the technology related costs, the retail business sourcing related cost. We have been buying a fair bit of priority sector lending certificates as well, that cost has gone up. You mentioned sales and advertisement promotion, those costs have gone up. So, all of these are costs which we believe are productive good costs undertaken to improve and increase our core operating profit. The other costs, more of administrative and infra kind of costs, those have grown in single digits actually in this period. One thing to keep in mind is that if you look at last year Q2, we had about a 5% year-on-year decline in our operating expenses. So, the base for us was indeed much   ICICI Bank October 23, 2021   Page 27 of 32 lower last Q2. So, some bit of that impact is there as well. Having said that, clearly in terms of the expenses that is there, we are running at a 20% or there about kind of run rate on expenses and that’s the trend in the absolute near term which one is seeing.	1462		2	 So, some bit of that impact is there as well.

467	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha  	  So, the way we work in the Bank is that each of the businesses have risk calibrated core operating profit as the key metric. As a part of that, expense is one of the variables and each of the business teams then looks at it and there is always a trade-off, one can always end up with a lower cost in the near term, if you kind of sacrifice a bit on the long term growth opportunity. That is something that we don’t do. Some of these expenses are needed for building franchise, maybe they will show results in the next 12-18 months kind of timeframe. But overall we are committed to growing the risk calibrated core operating profit. For the increase in expenses that we have, we will continue to work on improving our revenues in line with that. Given the pandemic, actually some of the numbers have been a bit up and down as I said, last year some of the expenses were lower and this year you will see the growth in expenses to be higher. From next year one will see a slightly more normalized number, but it would still be a growth which is high on the expenses side.	1071		2	 From next year one will see a slightly more normalized number, but it would still be a growth which is high on the expenses side.

474	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Gaurav Kochar 	  I have a few questions. Firstly, on margins, quarter-on-quarter there was a 11 bps improvement in margins. If I look at the CD ratio, it has moderated further to 78%. So, taking maybe a four to six quarter view or a medium term view, assuming your loan growth picks up and the CD ratio moves towards 85% sort of a mark, what is the outlook on margins? Also in that context, the share of unsecured credit right now is 10%, if I add up the personal loans and credit cards. Any sort of target internally that you would have built there? And say in the next two years, what would this be as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio? And as a result, what kind of margins can we look at from a 12-18 month or two-year perspective? That’s my first question.	755		2	 So, taking maybe a four to six quarter view or a medium term view, assuming your loan growth picks up and the CD ratio moves towards 85% sort of a mark, what is the outlook on margins.

475	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  So, it’s a very dynamic market and it’s very difficult to have a target on margins. At any point of time, we are always looking at protecting the margins first, and then seeing the opportunities to improve it. In the next year, something which all banks, including us, will face is that a lot of our loans will be linked to external benchmarks. So, we’ll have to see how the repo rate moves, how the T-bills move, and with respect to that, how the cost of deposits moves for the Bank. That’s an additional factor which has come in with loans being linked to external benchmark. Otherwise, definitely we are still sitting on surplus liquidity on the balance sheet. As that gets deployed, over time we would see some benefit on the margins from that side. On business mix, our unsecured portfolio had been growing at a faster pace than the overall portfolio prior to Covid-19, some bit of a slowdown happened during the pandemic period. We believe we should get back to more normal levels of growth on that side, but we don’t have any specific target on NIM in a two-year period.

Net NPA in corporate book are almost Rs. 20 billion. PCR on the retail book is 65% and apart from that, we are also carrying provisioning buffers. In FY2023, it’s very hard to estimate a credit cost of more than 100 bps, unless of course we see a third wave. What are your thoughts around this and in this year or maybe next year, do we see some writebacks from this Covid-19 buffer that you have made in the last 18 months or so?	547		1	 In FY2023, it’s very hard to estimate a credit cost of more than 100 bps, unless of course we see a third wave.

479	\icici\sep-21.pdf	Rakesh Jha 	  So, in two parts if I can take it. On the first one, we have said that through the cycle number that we look at on credit cost, is for it to be 25% of our core operating profit, which would be like 120-125 basis points of our loans. So, we should get back to that level once the pandemic is behind us for sure, because that is what we aim for while we build our portfolio. Regarding the Covid-19 provisions, it’s an assessment that we will keep on doing on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The portfolio of course has performed better than what we anticipated and it’s been better than what we would have taken into consideration while creating the Covid-19 related provisions. But we are not going to be in a hurry to unwind all of those provisions. We will assess it quarter by quarter, maybe at the year-end and we’ll take a call as to how we should do that. It’s something which gives strengths to the balance sheet so we don’t overthink around that.

Joining us today on this call are Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh, Anindya and Abhinek.  The Indian economy has seen a robust recovery from challenges posed by pandemic. However, we are currently experiencing volatility in the global economy and financial markets, geo political tensions and upward movements in inflation, interest and exchange rates. The authorities have been taking various measures to address the evolving situation.  At ICICI Bank, we aim to grow the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through a 360-degree customer-centric approach and by focusing on ecosystems and micro- markets.

Fourth-Leveraging digital across our business We continue to enhance our digital offerings and platforms to onboard new customers in a seamless manner and provide them end-to-end digital journeys and personalised solutions. These platforms also enable us to do cross sell and up sell. We have shared some details on our technology and digital offerings in slides 17 to 27 of the investor presentation.  Fifth - Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks The net NPA ratio declined to 0.61% at September 30, 2022 from 0.70% at June 30, 2022 and 0.99% at September 30, 2021.

This includes contingency provision of 15.00 billion Rupees made on a prudent basis. The Bank holds contingency provisions of 100.00 billion Rupees or about 1.1% of total loans as of September 30, 2022.

493	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya’s opening remarks 	 Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries. A. Balance sheet growth Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Coming to the growth across retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 20.4% year-on-year and 4.4% sequentially. Auto loans grew by 19.0% year-on-year and 5.2% sequentially. The commercial vehicles and equipment portfolio grew by 5.6% year-on-year and 0.6% sequentially. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 48.8% year-on-year and 11.8% sequentially. This portfolio was 1,077.49 billion Rupees or 11.5% of the overall loan book at September 30, 2022. The overseas loan portfolio, in US dollar terms, declined by 10.4% year-on-year and 19.4% sequentially at September 30, 2022. The decline in overseas book primarily reflects maturities of the short-term India-linked trade book. The overseas loan portfolio was about 4.0% of the overall loan book at September 30, 2022. The non-India linked corporate portfolio declined by 47.4% or about 387 million US dollars on a year-on-year basis. Of the overseas corporate portfolio, about 84% comprises Indian corporates, 7% is overseas      Page 5 of 22 corporates with Indian linkage, 4% comprises companies owned by NRIs or PIOs and balance 5% is non-India corporates.  On the liabilities side, Sandeep covered the growth in deposits. During the quarter, we raised long-term infrastructure bonds as well as refinance borrowings from domestic financial institutions. Overseas borrowings declined reflecting the reduction in assets.  B. Credit quality There were net additions of 6.05 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the current quarter compared to 3.82 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The net additions to gross NPAs were 5.93 billion Rupees in the retail, rural and business banking portfolios and 0.12 billion Rupees in the corporate and SME portfolios. The gross NPA additions were 43.66 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 58.25 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The gross NPA additions from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio were 36.58 billion Rupees and from the corporate and SME portfolio were 7.08 billion Rupees. The gross NPA additions from the corporate and SME portfolio include the impact of rupee depreciation on existing foreign currency NPAs. Recoveries and upgrades from gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 37.61 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 54.43 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 30.65 billion Rupees from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 6.96 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 11.03 billion Rupees. The Bank sold NPAs worth 0.94 billion Rupees on a cash basis in the current quarter compared to 0.13 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. Net NPAs declined by 25.3% year-on-year and 8.4% sequentially to 60.99 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022. The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 35.16 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2022 compared to 36.70 billion Rupees as of June 30, 2022. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 20.24 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2022 against this non-fund based outstanding.      Page 6 of 22 The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers under resolution as per various guidelines declined to 67.13 billion Rupees or about 0.7% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2022 from 73.76 billion Rupees as of June 30, 2022. Of the total fund based outstanding under resolution at September 30, 2022, 47.39 billion Rupees was from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 19.74 billion Rupees was from the corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 20.59 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines. C. P&L Details Net interest income increased by 26.5% year-on-year to 147.87 billion Rupees. The net interest margin was 4.31% in this quarter compared to 4.01% in the previous quarter and 4.00% in Q2 of last year. The net interest margin was 4.16% in H1-2023. There was no impact of interest on income tax refund on net interest margin in the current quarter. The domestic NIM was at 4.45% this quarter compared to 4.14% in the previous quarter and 4.09% in Q2 last year. The cost of deposits was 3.55% in this quarter compared to 3.46% in previous quarter. Of the total domestic loans, interest rates on 44% are linked to the repo rate, 5% to other external benchmarks and 21% to MCLR and other older benchmarks. The balance 30% of loans have fixed interest rates. The sequential increase in NIM reflects the impact of increase in interest rates on loan yields while repricing of deposits occurs with a lag. While policy rate hikes effected so far should further reflect in loan yields, we also expect to see the impact of repricing of deposits in future quarters. Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 16.8% year-on-year to 51.39 billion Rupees in Q2 of 2023  Fee income increased by 17.6% year-on-year to 44.80 billion Rupees in this quarter. Fees from retail, rural, business banking and SME customers grew by 19.0% year- on-year and constituted about 79% of the total fees in this quarter  Dividend income from subsidiaries and associates was 6.48 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 5.83 billion Rupees in Q2 of last year. The year-on-year increase in dividend income was due to higher final dividend from ICICI General and final dividend from ICICI Bank UK, offset in part by lower dividend from ICICI AMC and ICICI Securities      Page 7 of 22 On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 24.2% year-on-year in this quarter. The employee expenses increased by 21.1% year-on-year. The Bank had about 110,000 employees at September 30, 2022. The employee count has increased by about 9,800 in the last 12 months. Non-employee expenses increased by 25.9% year-on-year in this quarter primarily due to retail business and technology related expenses. Our branch count has increased by about 340 in the last twelve months and we had 5,614 branches as of September 30, 2022. The technology expenses were about 9% of our operating expenses in H1 of this year compared to about 8.5% in FY2022. The core operating profit increased by 23.6% year-on-year to 117.65 billion Rupees in this quarter. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries and associates, the core operating profit grew by 24.4% year-on-year. There was a treasury loss of 0.85 billion Rupees in Q2 compared to a gain of 0.36 billion Rupees in Q1 and 3.97 billion Rupees in Q2 of the previous year. The total provisions during the quarter were 16.44 billion Rupees or 14.0% of core operating profit and 0.71% of average advances. These include contingency provisions of 15.00 billion Rupees made on a prudent basis. The provisioning coverage on NPAs was 80.6% as of September 30, 2022. In addition, we hold 20.59 billion Rupees of provisions on borrowers under resolution. Further, the Bank holds contingency provision of 100.00 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, the total provisions, other than specific provisions on fund-based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing, were 200.59 billion Rupees or 2.1% of loans. The profit before tax grew by 39.4% year-on-year to 100.36 billion Rupees in this quarter. The tax expense was 24.78 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 16.90 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit after tax grew by 37.1% year-on-year to 75.58 billion Rupees in this quarter. The consolidated profit after tax grew by 31.4% year-on-year to 80.07 billion Rupees in this quarter.        Page 8 of 22 D. Growth in digital offerings Leveraging digital and technology across businesses is a key element of our strategy of growing the risk-calibrated core operating profit. We continue to see increasing adoption and usage of our digital platforms from our customers. There have been about 8 million activations of iMobile Pay by non-ICICI Bank account holders as of end-September. The value of transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders in Q2 of this year was 4.4 times the value of transactions in Q2 of last year. The value of credit card spends in the current quarter grew by 4.4% sequentially and 43.1% year-on-year. We saw a healthy growth in retail credit card spends driven by increase in discretionary spending, higher activation rate through digital onboarding of customers, including Amazon Pay credit cards. During the current quarter, we closed about 817,000 inactive credit cards as per recent RBI guidelines. The Bank has issued more than 3.5 million Amazon Pay credit cards since its launch. We have seen about 195,000 registrations from non-ICICI Bank account holders on InstaBIZ till September 30, 2022. The value of financial transactions on InstaBIZ grew by about 22.8% year-on-year in the current quarter. We have created more than 20 industry specific STACKs which provide bespoke and purpose-based digital solutions to corporate clients and their ecosystems. Our Trade Online and Trade Emerge platforms allow customers to perform most of their trade finance and foreign exchange transactions digitally. About 70% of trade transactions were done digitally in Q2 of this year. The value of transactions done through these platforms increased by 70.1% year-on-year in Q2 of this year. E. Portfolio information  We have provided details on our retail, business banking and SME portfolio in slides 34 to 44 of the investor presentation.  The loan and non-fund based outstanding to performing corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and below was 76.38 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022 compared to 82.09 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022 and 127.14 billion Rupees as of September 30, 2021. The amount of 76.38 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022 includes 21.98 billion Rupees of outstanding to borrowers under resolution.      Page 9 of 22 Other than one account in the power sector, where resolution has been implemented as per RBI’s Covid-19 resolution framework, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, we held provisions of 8.12 billion Rupees on the BB and below portfolio compared to 8.61 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022. This includes provisions held against borrowers under resolution included in this portfolio.  The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 735.73 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022 compared to 699.72 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022. The total outstanding loans to NBFCs and HFCs were about 8% of our advances at September 30, 2022. The sequential increase in the outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs is mainly due to disbursements to entities having long vintage and entities owned by well-established corporate groups.  The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans and working capital was 319.63 billion Rupees at September 30, 2022 compared to 275.69 billion Rupees at June 30, 2022. The builder portfolio is over 3% of our total loan portfolio. Our portfolio is largely to well-established builders and this is also reflected in the sequential increase in the portfolio. 6.8% of our builder portfolio at September 30, 2022 was either rated BB and below internally or was classified as non-performing, compared to 8.3% at June 30, 2022.

494	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Mahrukh Adajania 	  So, my first question is on deposit growth in the second half of this fiscal year. Obviously yours is a strong liability franchise, but liquidity is getting tight. HDFC's merger activity will also strengthen in the second half as they run closer to the merger. So, how do you see deposit growth panning out? And in terms of further expansion to margin, what is the outlook over the next 4 to 5 quarters?

495	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 So, on the first part, Mahrukh, as you know, retail term deposit growth for the system in general was quite soft over the last few quarters till the early part of this financial year given the level to which the deposit rates had gone down. As the retail term deposit rates have started to move up from the first quarter of this year, we have started to see good traction and momentum in the retail FD accretion. Having said that, the pace of increase in the retail FD rates has been much lower than what we have seen in the wholesale deposit market. But if we look at developments over the last couple of weeks, we are seeing a more accelerated increase in retail FD rates. Therefore, we will see an increase in retail FD inflows as the banking system moves up on the FD rates. We expect to see the retail FD deposit growth momentum to continue and to strengthen. On the second part on margins, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, given that 44% of the domestic book is linked to repo, we will continue to see some benefit on the yields in terms of the repricing as the repo rate increases. In fact, the last increase, which was on 30th September will have some impact. We do expect to see funding costs kind of move up at a quicker pace than what we have seen so far. So, net of that, will be impact on margin. We'll have to wait and see how it evolves.	1359		2	 Therefore, we will see an increase in retail FD inflows as the banking system moves up on the FD rates.

496	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Mahrukh Adajania 	  The other thing is in general on loan growth and the ability of consumers to bear the hike, right, loan growth has been very strong amidst rising rates and it's almost in defiance with the global macro. So, are you going to see a slowdown also as a hard landing or how does it shape? Why is the economy or why are consumers showing so much strength as never seen before and better than expected? Does it continue for 2 to 3 quarters?	435		2	The other thing is in general on loan growth and the ability of consumers to bear the hike, right, loan growth has been very strong amidst rising rates and it's almost in defiance with the global macro.

497	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee 	 So, as Sandeep mentioned, that the recovery from the pandemic in India has been quite strong and that is evidenced in a number of indicators, whether it is demand indicators or the resilience and recovery in bank loan portfolios in terms of the credit performance. So, those are all indicators that the consumer is in good shape.      Page 12 of 22 In terms of the cost of credit, part of what has happened so far is really a reversion to where the rates anyway were pre-pandemic and during this time incomes of customers would have gone up. But we have to see whether future rate hikes, the extent of pass- through that happens and what impact, if any, that has on the demand. Also it's a competitive environment, so banks are offering products to consumers at rates which they feel consumers will have offtake at.

We are looking at the overall macro environment both globally and in India in terms of risks to growth, the impact of inflation, interest rates and the geopolitical risk across our portfolio, wherever we feel that the risk markers are higher and some of these risks could manifest. On that basis is how we are looking at the contingent provisions. Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Krishnan ASV from HDFC Securities.

500	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Krishnan ASV 	  This is more to do with 2 things. One, we have generally seen an environment where loan repricing has been fairly fast because of EBLR, like that's evident. But also what we have observed is that the loan resets are faster. So, if the earlier contracted period, and this is not just true of ICICI Bank, I wouldn't have probably observed this specifically for ICICI Bank. But the system in general has moved from say a quarterly reset to a real-time reset so the day the RBI moves, immediately 50 basis points gets passed on, right? Does the      Page 13 of 22 RBI look at the same reset on the way down as well or do you anticipate that banks can continue to go back and forth between real-time reset and quarterly reset when the rate movement is adverse, right? So, that's the first question. The second question is also about deposit mobilization. The fact is you're now at nearly an 86% loan-to-deposit ratio given the kind of demand environment you're seeing. Could pricing be on the deposit side? Could we catch up on the deposit side pricing? Could that be faster say towards the end of the year?	1104		1	One, we have generally seen an environment where loan repricing has been fairly fast because of EBLR, like that's evident.

501	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee 	 So, on your first question, Krishnan, we don't have any real-time resets. So, our EBLR or repo linked loans reset every 3 months. So, there is no next month or immediate reset on our, say, home loans which are linked to EBLR. On the second part, as we spoke earlier also on this call that we have seen more increases in deposit rates recently than we had seen or larger increases than we had seen say broadly till September-end. So, it would be fair to assume that the repricing of deposits will pick up from here on.	518		1	 So, there is no next month or immediate reset on our, say, home loans which are linked to EBLR.

502	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Krishnan ASV 	  So, just as a related thing on the EBLR, I mean it almost seems like if the RBI does hike 100 basis points say incrementally from here till the termination, right, all of that 100 basis points gets passed on. This is something we have been trying to clarify from other banks as well. I mean, if you could share your thoughts. Is there any discretion you can exercise? If you see risk building up, you really don't want to kind of break the camel's back, right? So, would I mean banks be able to exercise any discretion saying that there comes a point beyond which I will absorb this on my P&L rather than pass it down further and increase asset quality risk or does that discretion not exist as things stand?	710		1	 So, would I mean banks be able to exercise any discretion saying that there comes a point beyond which I will absorb this on my P&L rather than pass it down further and increase asset quality risk or does that discretion not exist as things stand.

503	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee 	 So, I think that's hypothetical. I mean contractually  the loan resets at the spread over the EBLR. If the borrower is able to for example look at refinancing at a lower cost from a competing provider, then that can happen. So, they can exit my loan and go to a competing provider and take a loan at a lower spread. Yes, so that can happen. And in fact I guess as the rates go up, that can also be a factor in how spreads and margins move.

504	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Nitin Aggarwal 	  I have two questions. One is again on the provisions, which was touched upon earlier. As a percentage of PPOP, we are tracking significantly lower than the run rate that we have talked about in the past and core credit costs are running negligible now. So, how do you see this? Like how long can this continue and what will be our strategy in respect to making contingent provisions? So, will we continue to make more contingent provisions as the provisions to PPOP slows?	474		0	 Like how long can this continue and what will be our strategy in respect to making contingent provisions.

505	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 As I explained in response to Saurabh's question, we are not working out any percentage of PPOP or anything like that. It is entirely based on an analysis of the factors in the global and Indian environment and the portfolios where perhaps risk markers are a little higher than the average portfolio. That is what we do on a quarterly basis and we continuously review from the perspective of making these prudent provisions. In terms of how the specific credit costs will shape up, basis our current understanding and expectation, in the near term we would expect them to kind of significantly undershoot the normalised level. The reasons for that are that we are not seeing really any material NPL development on the corporate side. In fact, we are seeing some recoveries. And on the retail and SME side, we are coming off the pandemic related cycle so we are seeing actually recoveries out of those portfolios as well. And incremental additions are also well under control. So, credit costs would be lower than normal for some time.	1035		1	 The reasons for that are that we are not seeing really any material NPL development on the corporate side.

How do you see that because competition is talking about a very aggressive branch expansion. How are you looking at it? And any implications on the cost ratio? This quarter the cost ratios have moderated backed by strong revenues, but how do you see these 2 things going ahead?

507	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 As far as branches are concerned, we mentioned we've added about 340 branches in the last one year and we've added about 200 branches in the last six months and this pace of addition is somewhat higher than what we would have done in the preceding years. This is based on our own assessment of the market opportunity across different markets and micro markets where new economic nodes or new nodes of residential development are coming up and we need to have a physical presence to service that. One of the other things that we are also doing as a strategy is trying to move our colleagues closer to the market. So, that also results in expansion of the local footprint. I guess we would continue to expand our branches on this basis. So, you would see branch numbers going up over the next couple of quarters as well.	819		2	 So, that also results in expansion of the local footprint.

This is based on our own assessment of the market opportunity across different markets and micro markets where new economic nodes or new nodes of residential development are coming up and we need to have a physical presence to service that.	behind acquisitions complete increase neutral answered wrong concerned grow clear invest website confidential reported provided uncertain statement formed expanded good said comments started correct rise yes progress contribute growing expanding unclear positive history	acquisitions increase neutral there wrong concerned grow clear invest reference limited reported uncertain statement figures good said comments different correct rise yes progress growing down expanding not unclear positive expand history over

509	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 So, we really focus on the pre-provision operating profit and that naturally requires an appropriate management of operating expenses in relation to the revenue. Currently, as you rightly said, the revenue environment is pretty strong and we feel that there is a lot of opportunity for us to grow our business, to expand our franchise and therefore, we continue to invest in that and that's what we would continue to do. As we have said in the past, if in a quarter or two cost growth overshoots even revenue growth, we would not worry about it too much and if we find it to be a sustained thing, we can always make some adjustments. But currently we are looking at investing and expanding the franchise. Moderator:  The next question is from the line of Sharaj from Laburnum Capital. Please go ahead Shahraj: My question is on the contingent provision that you made. So, is there some specific segment of the book we are providing for against in times of crisis?

In fact, I would say that even if we look at the analysis that we had done at the start of the pandemic when the moratorium was on, this is one of the segments where the outcomes have probably been a little bit overall in line or better. But of course, in an environment of a lot of macro volatility, this could be a segment that will see some vulnerability.

This is related to when we are in a falling interest rate scenario which is quite far from here, but just to understand what you're thinking about it. The asset quality trajectory and the EBLR, both would not be working as a countercyclical thing. So, what is our thought process here? Because margins would also taper off and with the fall in the interest rate, there would be asset quality issues also coming up. So, the EBLR would not help for the system as a whole. So, your thoughts on this.      Page 17 of 22	542		1	 The asset quality trajectory and the EBLR, both would not be working as a countercyclical thing.

514	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 I'm not sure I understood the question. I think that repo rate increases so far have been quite well absorbed by the borrowers and clearly don't seem to be leading to signs of any higher delinquencies and we'll have to of course keep monitoring as the situation evolves. I don't think that in a falling rate scenario, there would be any negative impact on asset quality, if at all at the margin, risks could be in the rising scenario. From a bank margin perspective, therefore, it's not really in that sense countercyclical because bank's margins would also rise in a higher interest rate scenario	598		2	 I don't think that in a falling rate scenario, there would be any negative impact on asset quality, if at all at the margin, risks could be in the rising scenario.

515	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Rakesh Kumar 	  No, sir. Basically, I was trying to say that generally inflation is there when we are in a falling interest scenario and the NPAs significantly rise. When we see the credit growth numbers tipping off and the interest cycle coming down, we see asset quality issues. In those times because of this EBLR mechanism in place now, loan pricing would also be faster until and unless we change the benchmark itself like or if we do some changes there within the MCLR and EBLR. So, actually because of EBLR linkage, we would have adverse impact on credit yield also and then we would also have asset quality issues associated with the falling interest rate.	650		0	 So, actually because of EBLR linkage, we would have adverse impact on credit yield also and then we would also have asset quality issues associated with the falling interest rate.

516	\icici\sep-22.pdf	Anindya Banerjee  	 I don't think - it's a kind of reverse causation. Typically, in a normal cyclical tightening and loosening of monetary policy, we would not see such an impact. It could happen in a crisis situation. For example, if there is a big shock to growth, it is the shock to growth which causes the NPL and not the reduction in interest rates, which is also a consequence of the shock to growth. If it's a normal calibrated tightening and then unwinding of monetary policy, this should not happen. But I will sort of hedge by saying that we have not really seen a full cycle under the EBLR pricing regime. So, that is something that we have to see how it goes through both on the way up and the way down in terms of both margins and credit quality Moderator: The next question is from the line of Jignesh from Incred Capital. Please go ahead      Page 18 of 22 Jignesh: I wanted to discuss similar to what Krishnan was asking earlier. In this interest rate cycle side, can we assume that at least incrementally on the new loans not on the existing loans, which is repo-linked or these treasury-linked loans and all, considering that demand scenario becomes little fragile, in that case, can we take a hit on the spreads just to manage the demand? Is that kind of scenario also likely or the spread generally remains stretched all the time?	1331		1	 So, that is something that we have to see how it goes through both on the way up and the way down in terms of both margins and credit quality Moderator: The next question is from the line of Jignesh from Incred Capital.

As we said, it is a competitive market, so it's a decision of each lender based on their strategy and their funding costs as to what spread over the benchmark they offer on incremental loans. If we look at what has happened so far in terms of incremental lending, the pass-through would not have been uniform for all sort of segments of the market and we have to see how that goes along. Jignesh: Understood. But there is no regulation as such, right, which restricts you to cut down on your spreads? That is what I'm trying to understand.

542	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Rishi. Good evening. Wish you all a Happy New Year. And trust you and your dear ones are well and safe. Thank you for making the time to join us today. I am delighted to share with you that we had an extremely strong quarter with 7.0% sequential growth and 21.5% year-on-year growth in constant currency terms. Our year-on-year growth was the fastest we have had in 11 years. The growth was broad-based across industries, service lines and geographies, driven by our differentiated digital and cloud capability. This is a clear testament to the enormous confidence clients have in us to help them accelerate their business transformations. This outcome has been made possible by the relentless commitment from our employees to these challenging times. I am extremely proud as well as grateful for their extraordinary efforts in delivering success for our clients. Our growth has been accompanied by resilient operating margins at 23.5%. We have delivered these margins while we kept in the forefront our focus on our employees with increased compensation and benefit. Our digital business grew by 42.6% and now is 58.5% of our overall revenues. Within digital, our cloud work is growing faster, and our Cobalt cloud capabilities are resonating tremendously with our clients.  The strong overall performance stems from four years of sustained strategic focus on areas of relevance for our clients in digital and cloud, continuing re-skilling of our people, and deep relationships of trust our clients have with us. With the strong momentum in the business and the robust pipeline that we see, we are increasing our annual revenue growth guidance which was previously 16.5% to 17.5%, we are increasing to 19.5% to 20% in constant currency terms. Our operating margin guidance remains at 22% to 24%. With that, Rishi back to you and let’s have the questions from everyone on the call.	1889		2	 The growth was broad-based across industries, service lines and geographies, driven by our differentiated digital and cloud capability.

Obviously, the street will be very excited by the guidance upgrade that has come in terms of the revenue, but are you confident that the strong demand outlook will continue not only in the short term, but also in the medium term? What are you understanding in terms of the client spends and the budgets etc., and will this also reflect in the deal momentum going forward? The question for Nilanjan is on the margin picture. I would want to understand that margins have been fairly resilient till now but with the increase in supply-side pressure, what is the outlook basically on margin going forward and also how confident are you of meeting the demand given the high attrition that we are seeing. So, what is happening on the employee attrition being higher than 25.5%? Thank you.	937		2	Hi gentlemen, thank you so much for the opportunity and hope you guys have a safe and happy 2022.

545	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	  Thanks for your question. First, we have increased the guidance so there is tremendous confidence we are seeing with our clients. We had large deals of $2.5 bn, 25 deals in the quarter, our pipeline itself is very strong and we remain comfortable of the guidance for this financial year which ends in March. Overall demand environment looks strong. So, we are comfortable as we look out beyond March as well. The demand outlook is good, the digital transformation is strong, and our work in cloud and digital remains very good. We are also strong with our supply capabilities. So, we remain comfortable in delivering all the work for our clients. Let me pass it to Nilanjan for the second part.	696		2	First, we have increased the guidance so there is tremendous confidence we are seeing with our clients.

546	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Two questions you had and the first one on margins. We have been able to broadly hold our margins this quarter. We were 23.6% last quarter now we are 23.5% and a broad walk would be about 80-basis points have got invested back into our employees either through corrections or through promotions. 40-basis points we have actually lost because of lower utilization - which in a way of good news, as supply-side as you know pressure builds up, so our utilization coming down is a bit of good news. On the other hand, this has been made up by about 20-basis points of rupee and cross currency movement. We have also made up about 40-basis points from SG&A leverage and other one-offs and 50-basis points from a strong cost optimization program. So, all in all, that takes us to 23.5% and our guidance for the year as you know is 22% to 24% and we remain quite comfortable operating in that range. Coming to the supply side like we said we have taken up our graduate hiring program to 55,000 looking at this demand and we are very keenly looking at the attrition figures. One is how do we bring this down and we see stability for us coming in this quarter, although our numbers are more on a LTM basis so you would see those numbers inching up. But quarterly we have seen some sort of stabilization, and we continue to focus on all of these employee interventions and at the same time we do not want to let go off any demand. Therefore, hiring program as well as lateral program continues unabated.	1494		0	5% and our guidance for the year as you know is 22% to 24% and we remain quite comfortable operating in that range.

Therefore, hiring program as well as lateral program continues unabated. 5% and a broad walk would be about 80-basis points have got invested back into our employees either through corrections or through promotions.	behind increase underperformed grow clear invest stabilizing unchanged improving statement continue good said comments intact progress announcement comment outperformed unclear positive history over	behind acquisitions decline drop increase underperformed there fall grow clear invest stabilizing reference guidance weakening dropped unchanged confidential limited gained money reported improving benefited remain statement continue falling mixed layoffs lost announcements good said comments now overweight right cuts correct fallen yes rise intact progress contribute forecast comment down numbers announced changes unclear positive declined history closed over

Salil, my first question is what changed in three months for you to give such a large upgrade to your guidance and secondly on deal wins. We have the large deal win number at $2.53 bn, but increasingly the anecdotal evidence suggests that we are seeing a lot of shorter deals, so could you give up some sense of the sub $50 mn deals, how much higher is it, today say compared to three months ago or a year ago and even if you could tell us the deal pipeline, how would it compare to say a year ago, how much higher will that number be? Nilanjan, you indicated correctly right, the last 12-month attrition does not accurately capture the attrition numbers, so could you give us the sense of the quarterly annualized attrition, how do that number trend? Has it been flat quarter-on-quarter? Do you think attrition has peaked? Thank you.	913		2	Gentlemen, good evening, and congratulations on a very strong set of numbers.

549	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your question. I think first on the guidance we are really in a situation where all of the choices that we made over the last several years specifically building on digital, on cloud, on the new areas that our clients are looking for, what clients are buying, or where we see it resonates with clients, all of those digital transformation programs are very strong and we could see our execution remain good and that gave us, the ability to increase our guidance as we are in the fourth quarter here. We believe strongly that this is a sort of growth in the market, and we are fortunate with the trust of our clients to capture that. In terms of the pipeline, there were $2.5 bn large deals for us. Large deals are deals which we classify over $50 mn in size and so this is a very strong indicator to have when the business is evolving. We have 25 deals in that space, $2.5 bn. The overall pipeline today is larger than what we had at any time in our past. We remain comfortable with the pipeline and with where digital transformation programs are going. We remain aligned to what our clients are looking for. With that let me pass it to Nilanjan.	1158		2	I think first on the guidance we are really in a situation where all of the choices that we made over the last several years specifically building on digital, on cloud, on the new areas that our clients are looking for, what clients are buying, or where we see it resonates with clients, all of those digital transformation programs are very strong and we could see our execution remain good and that gave us, the ability to increase our guidance as we are in the fourth quarter here.

550	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  So, like I said we are very sharply focused on this figure, and of course, this is an industry issue and if I step back really, I think the volume growth for this industry has to come from freshers because churn at one level is just rotational, so as the freshers feed in across the industry just not in Infosys, I think, you will see this number inching down across all the players. We have seen in this quarter, while we do not declare the number, we have seen stabilization, and as we look ahead, we are seeing some drop-off of that, but we will have to wait and watch. But clearly, as we ramp up the freshers into the system, I think you should see some benefit across, so we are quite happy with where we are but agree that the numbers are high.	752		0	 We have seen in this quarter, while we do not declare the number, we have seen stabilization, and as we look ahead, we are seeing some drop-off of that, but we will have to wait and watch.

You have guided for 20% growth for the full fiscal. Do you see the momentum of deals and the negotiations of which you are currently in to take you to FY23 with a similar growth rate expected or do you see some tapering happening as we go into the FY23? Secondly a bit of color on the kind of transformation deals that are happening. Is it just digital transformation or now companies are also looking at other processes as well which companies like you can undertake going forward? BFSI and industrial, how do you see growth coming in from them? Do you see some bit of sluggishness coming in especially Europe where you have seen COVID impact that has happened in that region there and for Nilanjan you have mentioned about SG&A and cost optimization of 40 bps which you were able to bring in, is it a temporary one or can you bring in subsequent quarters as well to maintain that margin?	1020		1	 My first question is basically on the growth which we have been seeing.

553	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Sajeet. I think first on the growth, yes, the guidance increase is for this financial year, the demand outlook is very strong, the pipeline is larger. What we are working on today with clients on their transformation programs is still looking very good for us. Of course, we do not give  guidance for the next financial year just now, but everything you see in the demand environment is positive. The types of work that we are seeing that these relate to all aspects of large enterprises whether it is relating to how they are engaging with their customers, how they are engaging with their employees, how they are engaging with the ecosystem, essentially everything is becoming more and more driven by, how do you make it digital. For example, we have a platform called Equinox, which is essentially a platform which anyone can use in consumer products, which will build completely new e-commerce ability and we are seeing tremendous traction of this platform with all our clients. We have similar platforms in different industries which we are seeing some benefits from. In terms of growth, by region Europe is strong with 27% in the quarter. Our Financial Services also was strong for us at 15% in the quarter, so all of our markets are looking quite good in terms of growth. Of course, one of the strongest was manufacturing which was about 48% growth in the quarter. With that over to you, Nilanjan.	1413		2	 For example, we have a platform called Equinox, which is essentially a platform which anyone can use in consumer products, which will build completely new e-commerce ability and we are seeing tremendous traction of this platform with all our clients.

554	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Sajeet, on your question on margins, I think over the last few years, we have a very robust cost optimization program which we run across the organization. We have a number of levers which we deploy across this you know the onsite mix, the offshore mix, the pyramid, both onsite, offshore, automation which remains a big part of our cost optimization and in fact, we have taken to the next level by using bots at an extremely large scale and of course the other measures like subcon, etc., so we deploy this over each quarter. Sometime some of them like this quarter the onsite-offshore worked negatively against us, but we were able to have other cost optimizations come into place, namely, automation. We have also started looking at pricing in this high-demand environment. It is important that we start pricing our talent correctly as well and therefore whether it’s discounts etc., we are able to have some conversations and of course, we realize this is a long haul, it does not happen overnight. There are existing commitments to clients, but at least in new deals slowly this will start getting priced; and not only by us but also by the entire market as these costs start hitting the industry. So, there are a number of things which we are continuously doing, and we remain quite confident about this program as we look ahead. 	1337		0	 We have a number of levers which we deploy across this you know the onsite mix, the offshore mix, the pyramid, both onsite, offshore, automation which remains a big part of our cost optimization and in fact, we have taken to the next level by using bots at an extremely large scale and of course the other measures like subcon, etc. Sajeet, on your question on margins, I think over the last few years, we have a very robust cost optimization program which we run across the organization.

What you mentioned about inorganic growth in terms of acquisition, our acquisition of course remains very focused. We have a good pipeline of potential candidates. Our focus has been on what can we acquire which will give us a boost as you were saying in the digital transformation area. These relate to, for example, cloud or cybersecurity or IoT or other areas which are supporting digital, and we look at different companies in that. Of course, it is a combination of how will it fit culturally, how will we be doing integration, and what is the valuation, but this is an ongoing process, and we have a good pipeline that we are evaluating in terms of acquisition opportunities.

I think the first is about careers is how do we show a more longer-term career to all our employees that include a cycle of promotions, progressions so that people have visibility on that. Secondly of course is rewards and compensation, so we competitively always benchmark. Like I said before  that we have also rolled out special talent retention programs in this quarter as well and we will continue to do whatever is necessary going ahead. And thirdly is also reskilling that remains critical in this market as we have continuously upgraded our employee skills. So, we have this three- pronged strategy across these, and we are confident that we will be able to handle the attrition issue. For now, of course, there are a lot of market dynamics but over a longer period, we will see this coming down.	896		2	 I think the first is about careers is how do we show a more longer-term career to all our employees that include a cycle of promotions, progressions so that people have visibility on that.

Salil, I wanted to ask you that of course, deal wins have been strong, but you have these new deals that you have signed in the third quarter, are you seeing the pricing getting better from the previous quarter? Are the clients are ready to spend higher and are you able to command the pricing when you are signing these new deals? Secondly, more importantly, you said that most of the growth is coming from the manufacturing sectoral, can you give us some idea, what will be the situation for retail going forward? Nilanjan, one question for you, if you can give us a view on margins that margins going forward would be stable because this time, the cost for travel has not been incurred?

561	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thank you for that question. The pricing part which you are talking about, there what we are seeing is, we had a strong set of large deals, and we are seeing the pricing environment is quite stable. One of the things that Nilanjan mentioned earlier, which is there is real value to a lot of the digital work that we are doing, and we are putting that in place as we discuss large programs with clients and clients are receptive in this environment because they are seeing that we are a leading player for digital today in helping them in their transformation. So, we feel quite comfortable that while  this quarter’s pricing was stable, we will see something going ahead as we see an improvement in the value that we are communicating. Now, what are the type of spends. There are two types of spends. One is companies are increasing their spends on what they want to do for digital transformation so just as a percentage of their revenue that the amount that they want to spend on technology is going up. The second is in many companies we are seeing that they are looking at this also from a CAPEX perspective from something they want to invest for the future, it is not just an OPEX spend. Today we are seeing good traction in that sense on spends that is available when companies decide to launch the digital transformation and we feel comfortable to be partnering with them on that journey, Nilanjan, over to you.	1418		2	The pricing part which you are talking about, there what we are seeing is, we had a strong set of large deals, and we are seeing the pricing environment is quite stable.

Of course, as the next year progresses, we will have to see where does the travel open up at what stage, but having said that we have also seen that we have been able to strike these billions of dollars of deals pretty much virtually and in that sense that good news that we are able to work remotely in this new environment quite well and hopefully as the world opens up, we do not need to go back to the same kind of mad rush that we used to have, but I think that is something we will continue to look at these headwinds whether it is travel or cost increases on our employees and like I have said earlier our cost optimization program continues to be really in top gear and we have to work continuously to offset that. So, we remain quite confident in our 22% to 24% range for this year.	1059		2	Thanks, Harshada, on your travel question, I think the industry entirely is in a way not traveling and therefore there is a benefit which we have seen versus the pre-COVID area, but even if you strip that out you have seen that improvement in our underlying margins.

565	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thank you for your question. What we are seeing is there is a lot of different digital transformations going on in different sectors. So, one example was manufacturing, which is growing at 48%. We are also seeing for example in the retail sector, growth of 19.8%. We are seeing financial services which I mentioned earlier at 15.5%. Our communication segment is looking strong at over 22% growth. Life science is also looking very strong. What we see is across many industry companies are looking to launch their transformation and in doing that we see programs, which will go through a long duration. Many companies which have seen what has happened in the last 18 months with all of us working in a different way are starting to realize the benefit of driving digital. How do you get better connect with customers? How do you make sure your employee connect is better? How do you make sure your internal processes are more efficient because this is all allowing with customers buying their own growth, with employees to make sure there is a much more robust set of connections and that is helping us receive digital transformation being driven. Today really it is broad-based, the strongest being Manufacturing for us, Life Sciences, Communications and also Retail. Nilanjan, over to you.	1291		2	 How do you make sure your employee connect is better.  Life science is also looking very strong.

There are large deals which are entering the third, fourth, and fifth year where we are doing much more optimization. There may be new deals entering the portfolio, which are freshly minted and, in the sense, have initially higher costs and when we look at the overall margin structure that is all what we put together so the whole portfolio what is happening, deals are getting much more profitable on one side and one side and new deals are coming in. So, that is one part of the overall margin management equation. Secondly, like I said, we are putting in a lot of cost optimization.  Automation is one. The other is of course the pyramid and the freshers like we have said. When we started the year, we had said that we will hire around 25000 freshers, and in the third quarter we have hired around 55000 and that is helping at the bottom of the pyramid as well. So, we have a number of levers, and we keep on deploying those which are more relevant for the business, and they are helping us to make sure that these margins remain flat from quarter to quarter.	1161		2	 The other is of course the pyramid and the freshers like we have said.

568	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Sankalp Phartiyal 	 Good evening, everyone. Salil, I had two questions. One is that you said the pricing environment is very stable, but given the kind of uncertainty that the resurgence of COVID and the omicron wave has brought about could you give me a sense of what the demand environment, the pricing, and even the run side of business - the traditional business looks like in your biggest markets? The other thing I wanted to ask was that I was just attending Wipro’s press conference as well before coming here and they seem to say that attrition is going to be a problem for the next few quarters but perhaps would be moderate? You have outlined some plans, can you tell us what more are you doing to attract talent to your company and make them stay here because you are competing with startups that potentially offer more money and more ESOPs and incentives and also if there is any change in hiring plans whether you are stepping up freshers and laterals? Thank you.	957		1	One is that you said the pricing environment is very stable, but given the kind of uncertainty that the resurgence of COVID and the omicron wave has brought about could you give me a sense of what the demand environment, the pricing, and even the run side of business - the traditional business looks like in your biggest markets.

569	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for those questions. Nilanjan will come back on the attrition and the recruitment, which is very robust. On the pricing, what we discussed earlier, we are seeing a relatively stable environment in pricing if I look specifically at the deals, we have had in this previous quarter versus the quarter before that. So, we have not seen any big changes. What we have put in place that Nilanjan shared earlier are ways to communicate where we are creating tremendous value for our clients through the digital work and there, we would see over time that there will be some benefits through pricing. As we are seeing what we have done with compensation over the last 12  months with three different times, we have increased the compensation in a very significant focus on our employees. Those things will come, and we will be in a position overtime to get that sort of a pricing impact with our clients as well. So we feel quite comfortable today with a good demand environment, relatively stable pricing, and some initiatives, which are medium-term which will help us with more value with respect to the digital work we are doing. Nilanjan, over to you.	1154		2	Nilanjan will come back on the attrition and the recruitment, which is very robust.

570	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 The attrition question like I mentioned of course we remain very focused. It is absolutely critical for us, and this just takes a lot of our time. Besides what Salil mentioned in terms of the compensation interventions, the whole career pathing of many of these employees as we communicate, are long-term value propositions with Infosys for many of them. I think that is something we are rolling out. We are also looking at differentiated talent this year in our campus hires, so digital specialists with different skill set coming into the company. And thirdly, reskilling which remains core to our fundamental business model and how do we digitally skill tag employees, give them incentives to get reskilled in new technologies. So, it’s a plethora of things which we are looking at consistently and consecutively like I said, today it is an industry issue, this is not a company specific issue and as more and more freshers enter overall across the ecosystem, I think you will see this attrition across the industry and with us coming down.	1044		1	The attrition question like I mentioned of course we remain very focused.

Gentleman, I am going to read it out. For Salil, Shivani asks, what impact do you see of the recent COVID variant on business and operations, and what happens to back to office plans? Next, she asks what happens to the COO role? Will Infosys not have any COO? And Nilanjan, for you, Shivani asks what has been the impact of currency and what has been the impact of currency on margins, and what is the hiring target for FY2023?	556		1	 For Salil, Shivani asks, what impact do you see of the recent COVID variant on business and operations, and what happens to back to office plans.

572	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for those questions from Shivani. I think first what we are seeing with the current Omicron wave is in many ways all the impact will probably be in this quarter. Now we have seen some of  that start, of course, in Europe, we see that in the US, of course, in India we are seeing a big wave, in Australia as well. We have built some estimations based on what we think will be the way this will play out. In some ways, it seems to be a sharp up and then sharp down. In many ways maybe the impact of an individual may not be the same number of days and equally we have built very resilient processes where work from home has worked really well in the past and that’s been quickly put in place already. Having said all of that and factored that in this is how we build our guidance update. So, we are very comfortable today in what we are seeing, and how this will deliver work for our clients given what our estimate is as we look into the situation ahead from today. What we do with a return to the office discussions, we had started to see really good uptick on that in about a month or six weeks ago already, in India and other parts of the world. Of course, given what is happening today we are very focused on employee safety and wellbeing and right now it is much more remote working and work from home. But as we have learned if it follows what we have seen in some other countries this wave could be of shorter duration and then hopefully in back part of the quarter we will start to see more of the return to the office work but it is completely flexible today and very focused on what employees needs are, while we are making sure all the works planned is getting done.

573	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 So just to add to what Salil said today, 83% of our employees in India have got doubly vaccinated and another 10% have got the single dose so nearly 93% of our workforce in India is vaccinated so that is our metrics we have been tracking and increasing this period. Coming back to the hiring plans, of course, we have a very fluid plan both of freshers and laterals in the year. We have, like all other companies, gone out to campuses to hire but I think one of the big advantages is during this time we have been able to master both off campus fresher hiring program and a campus hiring program. So, we have the flexibility, both, to hire during the off campus period as well as demand changes, plus we have sort of a fixed demand which we will go out in campus. So that gives us a lot of flexibility as we look into the year ahead.	834		2	 We have, like all other companies, gone out to campuses to hire but I think one of the big advantages is during this time we have been able to master both off campus fresher hiring program and a campus hiring program.

576	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Saritha. I think what we are seeing for the calendar year from clients is a continuing of what they want to drive in terms of their change, their digital changes, their cloud changes, and all the programs we are driving. So, we do not see that something has changed either gone up or gone down, it remains at the same level of intensity and spends which has been high as you have seen for the last few quarters. In terms of consulting and technology, our experience with clients is really they are ready to build out the next phase of the technology environment. There is tremendous focus on modernization, there is a lot of focus on making sure that the digital infrastructure, the technology infrastructure is in place, the cloud infrastructure is in place, everything that is built is cloud-native, where we are looking to work with private cloud or public cloud in many ways leveraging what we are doing in Cobalt. So really the technology, digital transformation is the center of what we are seeing with clients and in that, we feel extremely well- positioned, because that is truly the strength of Infosys. Our delivery engine is extremely robust, and we have a portfolio capability of services which are focused on cloud and digital which are helping our clients to transform. Of course, consulting is a critical part, but consulting is a critical part as it helps to build the framework for these transformations, and the vast majority of what clients end up doing after the initial consulting is taking the technology spend in making all that  work. Our own consulting business is growing extremely well in that so the joined-up way with consulting and technology.	1682		2	I think what we are seeing for the calendar year from clients is a continuing of what they want to drive in terms of their change, their digital changes, their cloud changes, and all the programs we are driving.

So how do you see Infosys winning in such scenarios. Are you seeing more of these smaller deals in the market and Nilanjan a question on freshers’ salaries, is there a case for hiking fresher salaries considering it is pretty much stagnated, it has just seen a hike of 8% to 9% in the last decade, do you see a case for that? Final question Salil if you can give us an update on the income tax portal since the returns ended in December and for some cases, it has been extended to March if you can give us an update on that as well?

579	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Chandra. I think in terms of what we are seeing, in terms of the deals, the overall environment for large transformation programs is very robust, we have seen 25 deals in this quarter which have each above $50 mn where we have a difference which we talked about before is what happened is what you called the mega-deals which are much more volatile or lumpy, we still see a good pipeline where clients are looking at but those are not predictable in the sense of whether they will come this quarter or next. Our own experience is the volume of deals is very strong and robust. In many cases there are transformation programs which clients have launched, there are new programs being launched by other clients and those programs need different kinds of capabilities be brought together where we are helping to bring multiple service lines to help on that and sometimes clients break that up into different phases. In many of these cases once one of  these transformation programs starts and if things are going well, they continue on through different phases each of them being a significant outlay from a client’s perspective. Let me address the income tax project and then Nilanjan can address the other part. On the income tax project, we are extremely proud that from December 31, we have as was reported 5.8 Crores return filed through that timeframe. On the day itself, over 46 lakhs returns were filed. The deadline at that day was maintained in the way when the Income tax department saw all these things working and really all of them using the system saw all of that working. We are extremely grateful that we could help and contribute to the vision for Digital India that this is enabling. Going forward we are working of course, very closely with the department on the next set of areas and that will become part of this system as the new modules are put together and we are extremely happy and proud with how the December 31, closing and the ending of that deadline went with the 5.8 Crores returns.	2020		2	 In many of these cases once one of  these transformation programs starts and if things are going well, they continue on through different phases each of them being a significant outlay from a client’s perspective.

If you can talk about the pricing environment because the pricing of some of the hot skills has gone up by 4% to 8%. On one hand, you have supplies side challenges and clients willing to pay the premium for these hot skills. How are you staffing these large deals that require these skills? My second question is on how the integrated infrastructure deals are breaking up. Companies are looking at a modular way as to how they can be backloaded for profitability. So, if you can help us understand whether is re-platforming coming into play here?	676		1	 If you can talk about the pricing environment because the pricing of some of the hot skills has gone up by 4% to 8%.

583	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Shilpa. I think on the pricing what we are seeing as you were pointing out is, there is a lot of value that is created through the digital transformation work. We are seeing, of course, through this last year increase in compensation costs, we have had three of those within our structure, we know that that the large enterprises are looking at the world around them and for the first time, in a very long time we are seeing inflation that is in the environment. With all those factors, we are now more and more comfortable that we are able to discuss with our clients the value through the digital programs, and that translating into some pricing improvements over time. In terms of the infrastructure work and platforms, we have very much seen that I think there is a large cloud transformation that is in play with clients. We have mentioned our digital business growing at over 40%, our cloud business which is a subset of that is growing faster still and we see that by building out the new cloud ecosystem of our clients whether they are going with public cloud, whether they are going with private cloud whether it’s in a SaaS partnership, whether it is building new platform which is fully cloud basis, cloud-first platform. So very critical as a large part of where we have seen the future growth coming from.	1327		2	I think on the pricing what we are seeing as you were pointing out is, there is a lot of value that is created through the digital transformation work.

586	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your question. I think in terms of raising the guidance with the Omicron situation is separate and I will come back to address it. It is obviously a very serious concern for the health and safety of our employees and everyone around the world. Our guidance really came from an extremely strong performance that we saw in the third quarter with 7% growth QoQ, over 21% growth YoY. And the pipeline that we have seen of deals that we are working on and the large deals that we converted in Q3 which is at $2.5 bn, 25 deals across all our sectors, so those are the factors that we have put in place. And then seeing that we are very comfortable in scaling up our capabilities and capacities in supplying what our clients need in providing the service that they need. All those factors came in to increase the guidance. I think Omicron is a very important and serious health situation where we are extremely focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees. We have already moved very quickly as we have done in the last time on the work from home. Nilanjan shared the statistics on our vaccination. All around the world, we are supporting our employees and we have estimated what could be some of the impacts and how that work from home will be executed for our clients and then factoring that in then we have come up with the guidance, which we have increased for the full year.	1392		2	 Nilanjan shared the statistics on our vaccination.

The main focus for us was to make sure and is to make sure that everything we are doing with our employees is something that is supporting them, whether it is the engagement with them, looking after them, reskilling that is a big part of what Infosys has been doing all through the initial skilling, but we are all doing reskilling. The support through COVID where we did lots of different things, where we enabled medical and other support for our employees and then making sure that they are developing a long- term career with Infosys, building their skill and so on. This past quarter in Q3 we added over 12,400 people into the Infosys family. As Nilanjan shared earlier that our plan for this financial year is to recruit 55,000 college graduates and all of these things are making sure that we have ready people working on projects that our clients are looking to drive in their digital transformation and also helping to build a long-term career for all of the employees within Infosys.	1067		1	Let me start and if Nilanjan has anything to add, he can do that later.

Sai Ishwar Thanks for the opportunity. Salil Sir I just want to know your comment on the FY23 budget, I mean the calendar year budget for FY2022 from clients, and since BFSI is your biggest bucket do you see the BFSI clients especially rising in for federal reserve’s interest rate hikes. And Nilanjan another question for you, just a straight question, can you also share color on the ballpark figure on FY2023 campus higher targets?

In terms of financial services as a point of fed increasing or indicating that they will increase the interest rates, today our Financial Services growth was strong in Q3. We continue to see a good pipeline for programs  that we are working on, there also the digital transformation and the cloud work is going extremely fast. At this stage, we are not seeing that any of them have changed their spending or their technology focus with the fed interest rates. Of course, we will see how the year progresses and if that makes any changes on board.	913		2	 In terms of financial services as a point of fed increasing or indicating that they will increase the interest rates, today our Financial Services growth was strong in Q3.

So, I think that is something which we have sort of perfected during this COVID times, so we remain quite confident of meeting the overall demand requirement for the next year.	486		2	 So, I think that is something which we have sort of perfected during this COVID times, so we remain quite confident of meeting the overall demand requirement for the next year.

We do not separate in any other parameter so this gives a good indication that the more digital we are doing, the more our revenue per employee will go up and with that now growing at 40% and sitting at a very high level is what is reflecting in some of the parameters. In terms of net new in the large deals our net new was 44% in the large deal and so again that gives us a good level of confidence that this continues revenue growth momentum as we look ahead in the future.	573		2	The revenue per employee is a very good indicator which shows how our digital work is changing.

598	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your question. I think on hybrid we have seen a tremendous amount of evolution and maturity over the past year and half, two years as we have put this into place. The first, there is a huge amount of flexibility that is now being built into our system, which allows our employees to work remotely in any configuration. It was hugely supported by our clients and all the  infrastructure that we had built ahead of when COVID started, held us in good stead as we were able to quickly drive. Today we are able to go back and forth. With this current wave we also move very quickly to remote working and work from home. What we will do over the next several quarters as we see the situation evolving is enable employees to work in a hybrid fashion and also open up the campuses as and when the medical safety allows us to do that. We want to make sure that we have tremendous flexibility for our employees and then also support our clients where we need to and where there are requirements where the teams work together for different parts where they need to move and re-engage in building the social capital. That is the approach that we put in place. We have been able to flex on this up and down as we see even in the last few weeks with the new wave coming in and we feel comfortable over time that we need to do more on that in the medium and long term. In terms of the discussion on the telecommunication space our acquisition approach is something we are very focused on. It is really looking at what is going on within the digital ecosystem, the cloud ecosystem, whether it is in cyber security or the experience or IoT. These are the areas that we put in the most focus and effort and we are making sure that we look at the steady pipeline of situations in that. What we had recently was a very strong partnership with Singtel which is a longstanding client for us and someone who has a lot of trust with Infosys. In that situation we expanded some of the work that we did through the acquisition that you referenced, but we have in general an overall picture of driving acquisition in the digital space, and we will continue to do that across all of the sectors we work in.	2191		2	 It is really looking at what is going on within the digital ecosystem, the cloud ecosystem, whether it is in cyber security or the experience or IoT.

610	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Good evening and good morning to everyone on the call. Wish you all a Happy New Year and trust you and your dear ones are well and safe. Thank you for making the time to join us today. I am delighted to share with you that we had an extremely strong quarter with 7.0% sequential growth and 21.5% YoY growth in constant currency terms. Our YoY growth was the fastest we have had in 11 years.  4 The growth was broad-based across industries, service lines and geographies driven by our differentiated digital and cloud capabilities. A strong broad-based growth in a seasonally weak quarter is a clear testament to the enormous confidence clients have in us to help them accelerate their business transformation. This has been made possible by the relentless commitment of our employees through these challenging times. I am extremely proud as well as grateful for their extraordinary efforts in delivering success for our clients. Our growth has been accompanied by resilient operating margins at 23.5%. We delivered these margins while keeping in the forefront our focus on employees with increased compensation and benefits. Our digital business grew by 42.6% and is now 58.5% of our overall revenues. Within digital, our cloud work is growing faster, and our Cobalt cloud capabilities are resonating tremendously with our clients. Some of the highlights of our results are 1. Revenues at $4.25 bn, with a growth 21.5% YoY and 7.0% sequential in constant currency 2. Broad-based growth across all our industries, service lines and geographies. All our segments reported a strong double-digit growth, 3. Large deals at $2.5 bn, 4. Onsite mix at 23.8% and utilization at 88.5%, 5. Operating margins strong at 23.5%, 6. Free cash flow at $719 mn, 7. Attrition increased to 25.5%. Our quarterly annualized attrition was flattish on sequential basis. 8. We had a net headcount increase of 12,450, attracting leading talent from the market. We have increased our annual college recruiting target to 55,000, and Nilanjan will comment more on this. We remain comfortable with our ability to support our clients in their digital transformation journey.  5 Financial Services grew at 15.5% in constant currency with broad-based growth across geographies and steady deal wins. Various subsectors like lending, mortgage, cards, payments are seeing increasing demand and clients are driving cloud transformation initiatives to build resilient and scalable platforms. Retail segment growth was 19.8% in constant currency. Across sub-verticals we see increased client spend on digital transformation including digital supply chain, omnichannel commerce and large-scale cost take out initiatives to improve business resilience. We signed six large deals in this segment during the quarter. The communication segment grew at 22.2% on constant currency. Segment performance continued to improve with ramp up of recently won deals. Client budgets are focused on digital and customer experience programs, increasing networking infrastructure, cloud adoption and security with emphasis on 5G roll out and innovation spend. Energy, utility, resources and services vertical continued its steady performance with 13.6% constant currency growth and 5 large deal wins. We are seeing gradual improvement across various businesses as consumer spending continues to increase and clients focus on increasing technology transformation around areas like customer experience, cybersecurity and workload migration to the cloud. The manufacturing segment growth accelerated to 48.4% in constant currency with continued ramp up of the Daimler deal and steady momentum in new deal wins. We see across the broad improvement within various subsectors and geographies and expect client focus to continue in areas like smart manufacturing, IOT, digital supply chain and connected products. High tech growth improved during the quarter to 18.9% in constant currency. Clients are seeing renewed momentum in terms of spending on digital transformation programs linked to customer, partner and employee engagement. Life Sciences segment performance also improved further to 29.2% growth. Adoption of digital health, telehealth and patient access programs are resulting in significant uptake of cloud, IoT, patient facing applications, patient portals and next generation CRM work.  6 We had a very strong performance on our income tax program in India. Over 5.8 crores or 58 mn tax returns were filed using the new system, by the deadline of December 31, 2021. On the last day over 46 lakhs or 4.6 mn tax returns were filed and during the peak hour over 5 lakh or 500,000 tax returns were filed. We are proud to be supporting the digital strategy for India and for the government and working on this program for future modules that will be developed. Across digital services in Q3 we have been ranked as a leader in 12 digital service-related capabilities from Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Cloud Services, IoT, Engineering, Modernization and Big Data and Analytics. The strong overall performance stems from four years of sustained strategic focus in areas of relevance for our clients in digital and cloud, continuing reskilling of our people and deep relationships of trust our clients have with us. With this strong momentum in the business and robust pipeline we are increasing our annual revenue growth guidance from 16.5% to 17.5% moving up to 19.5% to 20% in constant currency. Our operating margin guidance remains at 22% to 24%. With that, let me hand it over to Nilanjan for his update.	5563		2	 The manufacturing segment growth accelerated to 48.

611	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Thanks, Salil. Hello everyone and thank you for joining the call. Let me start by wishing everyone a very happy and safe 2022. Q3 was another successive quarter of continued acceleration in revenues at 7.0% constant currency QoQ growth and 21.5% constant currency YoY growth, the highest YoY growth in the last 11 years. Despite the Q3 seasonality, we registered strong broad-based growth across geographies and verticals. Our largest geography North America grew at 21.4% while growth in Europe accelerated to an impressive 27.2% YoY in constant currency terms. Retail, Communication, Manufacturing and Life Sciences also saw 20% or higher YoY growth in constant currency. We won 25 large deals, and large deals being those with over $50 mn TCV, totaling $2.5 bn of TCV - 6 in Retail, 5 each in Financial Services, Communications, and Energy Utilities  7 Resources and Services, 2 in Manufacturing and 1 each in Hi-Tech and Life Sciences. Region wise, 16 were from the Americas, 7 were from Europe and 2 from RoW. The share of new deals increased in Q3 to 44% within the large deal numbers. Client metrics improved further with $100+ mn client count increasing to 37, an increase of 8 YoY. We added 111 new clients in the last quarter. Operating parameters remain robust. Utilization was 88.5% slightly lower than the previous quarter easing some of the supply side pressures. Onsite effort mix inched up marginally to 23.8%. Q3 margins remained resilient at 23.5%, a marginal drop of 10 basis points versus previous quarter. The major components of the sequential margin movements were as below. • 80 basis points impact due to comp hikes and promotions and other employee interventions. • 40 basis points impact due to the utilization decline. These were offset by • About 20 basis points benefit due to the rupee and other cross currency movements, • 50 basis point benefit due to cost optimization, and • 40 basis points benefit due to SG&A leverage other one-offs included therein. Q3 EPS grew by 11.2% in dollar terms and 13.1% in rupee terms on a YoY basis. Although DSO increased to 71 days due to higher seasonal billing, an increase of 5 days versus the last quarter, it is still a reduction of 2 days versus Q3 of prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was healthy at $719 mn. Free cash flow as a percentage of net profit was 93% for Q3 and 104% for the nine months till date. Yield on cash balances improved to 5.29% compared to 5.13% in Q2.  8 Our balance sheet remains strong and debt free. Consolidated cash and investments at the end of the quarter stood at $4.28 bn after paying over $840 mn of interim dividend during the quarter. Return on equity increased further to 30.4% an increase of 3% over Q3 of the prior year driven by robust performance and consistent capital returns through share buyback and increased dividend payout. On the employee front, voluntary 12 months attrition increased to 25.5% and as Salil commented while LTM attrition continues to increase due to the tail effect, quarterly annualized attrition was flattish compared to Q2. We will continue to invest in all aspects of talent retention including compensation, promotion, skill incentives, learning and career progression. We have also simultaneously increased the pace of hiring, talent reskilling and the usage of subcon to prevent any impact on client commitment. We have added 12,450 talented employees on a net basis in the last quarter, which is the highest ever. Our global college graduate hiring program for this fiscal has been increased to over 55,000 versus the previous quarter number of 45,000. In India over 93% of Infoscions have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Over 97% of our employees globally are presently working in remote environment, due to the heightened precautions against the new variant. Driven by robust demand environment and our continued market share gains, we are further increasing our revenue guidance for FY22 to 19.5% to 20% in constant currency terms from 16.5% to 17.5% earlier and the margin guidance remains unchanged at 22% to 24%. With that we can open the call for questions. Moderator Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.  9 Ankur Rudra Thank you. Happy New Year to everybody. Excellent numbers for the quarter. Clearly a very strong growth for Q3.

612	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 I think what we are seeing in the quarter and then all through the year, is the demand environment remains extremely strong and then more and more traction on the digital and the cloud programs. This is where we saw the most impact in the quarter in Q3 where we had really strong growth of 7% and therefore the overall guidance jumping up by 3%. In terms of verticals, as I was sharing earlier, it is broad based. Of course, we have a very strong momentum in Manufacturing, that was something that we were looking forward to. There is also good momentum that we are seeing in Financial Services given it is our largest vertical, and in Life Sciences that I described before. Retail is starting to come back nicely as well. As Nilanjan mentioned, Europe again was a stand-out. Those are some of the elements that gave us a good outcome in Q3 and then the support for expanding the guidance for the full year. Moderator Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Moshe Katri Thanks. Happy New Year and congrats on very strong results. One, I know you just reported Q3 but are you ready to talk about the entire calendar year down the road, 2022. What has changed in terms of visibility, may be that is the biggest question if this is sustainable down the road. And what can you talk about in terms of color to give us that comfort. And then maybe you can talk a bit about some of the cushion in margins and what sort of levers that you have in the model, especially as some of the bench continues to benefit from the off campus recruiting that has been pretty robust?  10	1619		2	 Happy New Year and congrats on very strong results.

Of course, as you referenced, we have guidance till March 31 of this year. The color for this calendar year, broadly we see the demand environment remaining strong, the client budgets are looking good. Our overall pipeline is the largest we have had in a very long time, the number of large deals that we were able to close, as Nilanjan shared- 25 large deals each over $50 mn for a total of $2.5 bn and 44% of these are net new. So, all of those things are giving us good confidence to what we see going ahead. Of course, we will have our guidance for our financial year in April. Nilanjan over to you please.	701		2	I will start off with the first part and then Nilanjan will comment on the margin levers.

614	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Moshe, on the margins, like I mentioned earlier they were quite resilient for the quarter. A couple of things I just want to call out – the cost levers whether it is onsite or offshore mix, the pyramid, whether it is automation – these are some of the things which we continuously look at deploying. Subcon costs for us have really ramped up and that is an area we will continue to look going ahead. The other thing is pricing and it is important to talk about that as the higher cost now starts feeding into our new deals, that should hopefully have benefits and as digital talents start getting priced in, we are able to show value to our clients in terms of the business transformation. This is something we have started recently. It will take time to pick up and we have talked about it in the last quarter as well. But really that is our focus - we can start getting into both our cost side and also make sure that we are not leaving any free cents and dollars on the table as part of our pricing negotiations. Moderator Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas.

So, looking at our portfolio of  11 capabilities and offerings, do you see that we are well aligned to meet or beat their growth numbers or do you see that we need some intervention to build up our own capability to continue this strong growth going ahead?	505		2	 So, looking at our portfolio of  11 capabilities and offerings, do you see that we are well aligned to meet or beat their growth numbers or do you see that we need some intervention to build up our own capability to continue this strong growth going ahead.

616	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for that question. I think in terms of our key capabilities set we have a strong portfolio across digital and cloud. Our Cobalt set of capabilities is resonating extremely well with our clients. We see the growth of digital being a reflection of the focus we have had on making these choices over the past four years and positioning the portfolio to where the clients are looking for work. We also see the cloud capability faster growing than our digital capability. So yes, we are well positioned to benefit from this. In addition to that, we have a strong set of capabilities in automation, in modernization. We have even seen our core services which is now stable this quarter in terms of growth, it is not shrinking. Our view is that our set of capabilities and portfolio is reflecting what our client expectation/demands are and we have the ability to meet all those from the capability perspective. We also have the capacity to expand and recruit at the college level and our ongoing recruiting ability to attract talent, which is helping us to deliver all our projects on a regular basis. So, we feel quite good on how we are positioned as we go ahead into the next year as well.	1194		2	 We also see the cloud capability faster growing than our digital capability.

Currently we are trending to the upper end so how should we see that? Is it that you want to keep flexibility with yourself in anticipation of any large deals or any cost headwind potentially coming from that or is there an indication that you are looking at some major cost headwind which are going to come in, in the coming quarter and hence you are maintaining this margin guidance band?	490		1	 Currently we are trending to the upper end so how should we see that.

So, this is a band which we are happy to be in. It was 21% to 23% just before COVID. Now we are 22% to 24%. So that is more like a way for us  12 rather than anything else. And looking ahead, we continue to focus on our cost headwinds potentially in terms of employees, etc., it could be travel into the next year, but like I said we have a very robust cost optimization and of course other levers, which we continue to deploy, so we are quite confident on this.	599		2	The margin guidance for us is really a comfort range within which we operate so we really do not fine tune that as the year progresses.  it could be travel into the next year, but like I said we have a very robust cost optimization and of course other levers, which we continue to deploy, so we are quite confident on this.

622	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  13 I think that we do not give up the margin guidance for the next year. Now having said that looking at the headwinds, which we actually say pretty much every year are the compensation hikes, you have clients coming back for discounts on renewals, and some of that you offset with the cost optimization program which we run, and I mentioned that a bit earlier in terms of whether it is a pyramid, whether it is subcon, whether it is automation, new levers which we are looking at is pricing. So, that is something which we are continuously working on and remain quite confident. Travel is one thing which is quite unknown at this moment in terms of when does it come back, even if it comes back does it come back to pre COVID levels or in a slightly lower levels so we will have to watch out for that really. In terms of attrition, I think it is a larger industry issue. It is not peculiar to us and fundamentally the volume increase for this industry has to come from freshers. Otherwise, it's a zero-sum game – somebody else's attrition is my lateral and my attrition is somebody else's lateral. So as long as the fresher intake starts increasing because first they have to come into training, then they go into production after 3 or 4 months and that is something which will help with the attrition in the medium term; and like I said we have seen attrition flattening sequentially on a quarterly annualized basis and looking ahead we are seeing some positive signs, but it is too early to say whether it will dramatically come down. But like I said, as freshers feed into the system we should see the overall environment in terms of attrition in the market improving.	1674		2	 Now having said that looking at the headwinds, which we actually say pretty much every year are the compensation hikes, you have clients coming back for discounts on renewals, and some of that you offset with the cost optimization program which we run, and I mentioned that a bit earlier in terms of whether it is a pyramid, whether it is subcon, whether it is automation, new levers which we are looking at is pricing.

624	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 In terms of utilization, this is higher than what we would normally like to be. We would rather operate at 85% to 86%, but having said that even if we bring this down in the future it is largely at offshore locations because 75% of our effort is sitting there. Therefore, utilization does not directly link to the margins because of the way the offshore costs operate, so that is one factor.  14 The second question, in the long run - if you see, COVID, while it had a huge impact on demand, the entire ability for the supply side to deliver in a remote environment really will shine up, and that has opened up the eyes of many of our clients that every work does not have to be done onsite. It can be done in a near shore location, it can be done offshore and I think the beauty of that is secularly we believe this will help the industry in a much more larger offshoring at an overall level and of course part of that benefit will be shifting more work to offshore locations. So, I think this is a good sign. I think there can be short term impacts like we saw this quarter, 10 to 20 basis points here and there, but the secular trend - we think we will continue to see that the large global markets will open a lot more offshoring opportunities.	1249		2	 It can be done in a near shore location, it can be done offshore and I think the beauty of that is secularly we believe this will help the industry in a much more larger offshoring at an overall level and of course part of that benefit will be shifting more work to offshore locations.

I think on pricing first we have seen some level of stability in what we saw in the specific deals that we closed in Q3 versus Q2. On the longer term, Nilanjan has shared in the past we have put in place a very focused effort on communicating the value that we are helping create with our clients through the digital programs. We are also seeing as we have shared wage increases, we have done three in the last 12 months and broadly we are seeing large enterprises for the first time in a very long time are  15 seeing inflation in their daily environment and so are more open to having these discussions. With these factors in mind, we really see some more value that we can bring in through communicating and demonstrating our digital impact that we are creating through those programs. And that, while it will not be immediate, over the next several quarters, in my view will help us to build out more resilience in the margin profile.

Those would be really the first areas where we are already leading, but we will continue to grow. Then you have the areas which focus on cybersecurity, which focus on data and analytics, which focus on IoT. Those are the areas which are seeing incredible traction with our clients.

Salil, I have a very simple question, you see now you know, our core which is 41% to 42% of the business is stabilizing on a YoY basis, it is probably little growth is there, but digital continues to be at 40% plus growth, so if this trend continues next year, may be our core may become 32% to 33% of the overall pie, so what is your sense from a long term perspective, where do you see this core stabilizing or do you think it will be unfair to see them separately and in the next two to three years you think everything will converge together. So, any idea, anything which you can say on that front will be very helpful.	765		2	Good evening to the management team, happy New Year and thanks for taking my question.

First as you pointed out, the digital growth is strong at over 40% or 42% and that shows resilience, the demand profile and our portfolio which is overlapping. The key for the core, instead of looking at the percentage of the business, the key for us is really the  18 core is now stable with a very small growth, so we did not see the decline that we had for some quarters and this makes it extremely strong for us. We have probably the best capability in automation and modernization across the industry and with this while everyone else’s core is still shrinking, ours will be stable or possibly even have a small uptick and that means we will be the most competitive in this area. So, I am looking at this as a very positive step. We of course have to maintain this, and we have to keep building out our automation capabilities. So, if we succeed in that, I think that is a very good outlook for us in the quarters ahead.	952		2	 We have probably the best capability in automation and modernization across the industry and with this while everyone else’s core is still shrinking, ours will be stable or possibly even have a small uptick and that means we will be the most competitive in this area.

639	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nitin Padmanabhan 	 Good evening, everyone and thanks for the opportunity. I had two questions. The first is on the employee side. If you look at the employee cost under cost of revenue, it has consistently been down as a percentage of revenue, it has actually below what it used to be pre-COVID and a lot of growth has actually been added on the subcon side and even if you look at the numbers, it looks like most of the additions are all freshers. So, keeping this dynamic in mind, just wanted to understand as we go forward and may be attrition normalizes, how do you see this subcon evolving from an operational perspective, do you think you will have to hire these subcontractors directly on to your rolls and would that involve slightly higher cost, so how should one think of this dynamic overall was the first question? The second question was around the digital proportion of the business has meaningfully gone up and if you look into the next year and I am sure it will be even higher. From that perspective does that mean that our ability to sort of garner price increases will be far higher going into next year than what you see today? Thank you.	1140		1	 If you look at the employee cost under cost of revenue, it has consistently been down as a percentage of revenue, it has actually below what it used to be pre-COVID and a lot of growth has actually been added on the subcon side and even if you look at the numbers, it looks like most of the additions are all freshers.

640	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  19 I will take the first question on subcon. As Salil said the demand environment is so strong that we do not want to leave anything on the table and therefore whether it is through subcon or through lateral or freshers, we will first intend to fulfill that demand and of course over a period of time we will optimize that entire structure. So, whether it is programmed to rehire some of the subcon, some of them we will of course lapse and then we will get the lateral hires, some will be promoted, so within that the dynamics will play itself out over the next year. But at the moment it is critical that we do not leave any demand in the table and of course this will remain a optimization lever for us. We were one of the lowest in the industry at about 6.9%, pre- COVID and we are above 11% now but this is the lever, we will have over the medium-term to optimize.	871		1	 As Salil said the demand environment is so strong that we do not want to leave anything on the table and therefore whether it is through subcon or through lateral or freshers, we will first intend to fulfill that demand and of course over a period of time we will optimize that entire structure. 19 I will take the first question on subcon.

Because in any case, as you know, this is India rate plus other countries. 25% is India-only rate. So I think, in the long run, you will be around this range itself.	296		1	 Because in any case, as you know, this is India rate plus other countries.

And in the first two years, as we have announced, we have actually paid back 82% through higher increased normal dividends and also through share buyback which we announced last year.

664	\infosys\dec-21.pdf	Vimal Gohil 	 Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on a great quarter. My question is on your employee cost which partially has been addressed but how should we think about the core employee cost growth which comes under the cost of revenue which has seen around 4% CQGR increase over Q1 of FY2021 versus the 6% revenue growth and this has been in light of a very sharp increase in attrition and of course further supply challenges and etc. So, if you can just highlight, are our wage hikes in line with the industry or have they been much higher than the industry? How should we think about this historically and if you could give some kind of an outlook over there as well? Thanks.	683		2	 My question is on your employee cost which partially has been addressed but how should we think about the core employee cost growth which comes under the cost of revenue which has seen around 4% CQGR increase over Q1 of FY2021 versus the 6% revenue growth and this has been in light of a very sharp increase in attrition and of course further supply challenges and etc. Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on a great quarter.	increase underperformed there grow changed clear here remarks statement good benefit said comments beat right responded correct yes progress report contribute unclear over	over increase underperformed there changed clear here remarks great statement jump good benefit said comments started beat right responded correct yes progress report contribute comment open unclear positive declined welcome

Number two, just from an overall cost perspective, we of course are very focused on the attrition and being competitive in the markets as well as being employer of choice for many of our employee. Going ahead when we look at intervention on the compensation side like Salil said, we did across, in January, we did across the board, in July we have done across the board, in Q3 as well we have done very segmented and for targeted talent and we will continue doing that into Q4 etc., looking at high points of attrition and doing it much more tactically to see where we are seeing demand being high in the markets for those skills and target those employees really.

682	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Sandeep. Good evening and good morning to everyone on the call. Thank you for joining us. We are delighted to share with you that our Q3 performance was strong with year-on- year growth of 13.7% and quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.4%. This performance was in a seasonally weak quarter for us and amid a changing global economy. We continue to gain market share.  Growth in Q3 was broad-based, with most industries and geographies growing in double digits in constant currency. Growth in constant currency for nine months of FY23 was 17.8% compared to the same period of FY22. Our large deal value was $3.3 bn, the highest in eight quarters. With 32 large deals, this is the largest number of large deals in our history, 36% of this is net new. Our pipeline of large deals remain strong. Our digital revenue grew at 22% in the quarter in constant currency and are now close to 63% of our overall revenue. Our core services revenue grew at 2.4%. We are seeing growth in both areas of our business, digital and core services. This is a testament to our industry-leading digital capabilities, including our Cobalt Cloud capability and our industry-leading automation capabilities, both of which are resonating with our clients. Our large deal pipeline is seeing increased traction for automation and cost efficiency programs. Our results reflect our deep-rooted client relationships, coupled with client- centric strategy, differentiated digital and cloud capabilities, strength in automation and the ability to pivot our business rapidly to changing client needs. Our cloud revenues continue to have healthy growth this quarter. Our clients are focused on accelerating the digital and cloud transformation, both to grow and to become operationally more efficient. They trust us to partner with them through the complexity of managing this change because of our differentiated capabilities. Our industry-leading cloud offering, Cobalt, is playing a key role in helping them navigate the digital transformation. Two examples of this, - Cobalt is helping accelerate business growth and resilience for a large telco and making their decision-making more data driven. - We are supporting a leading aerospace company by automation of their customer experience area, leveraging a modernized technology infrastructure, driving material cost efficiency. Strong growth was accompanied by stable operating margin at 21.5%. This was driven by healthy revenue growth and cost optimization benefits. Our operating margin for the first nine months of FY23 was at 21%, in-line with our margin guidance.  Our voluntary quarterly annualized attrition continues to decline steadily and reduced by 6 percentage points sequentially to well below 20% for this quarter. We are encouraged by the immense confidence and trust that clients have in us. The signs around us, around the slowing global economy are visible. Some areas such as mortgages and investment banking and financial services industry, telco, high-tech and retail are more impacted and that is leading to delays in decision-making and uncertainty in spending in these areas. We are confident that the strength of our digital and cloud capabilities and our automation capabilities will continue to position us well in the market. We are keeping a close watch on the global economy. Driven by our growth of 17.8% in constant currency for the first nine months of FY23 and strong large deal value for Q3, we are increasing our revenue growth guidance, which was at 15% to 16% earlier to 16% to 16.5%, despite the changing global economic conditions. We are retaining our operating margin guidance for FY23 at 21% to 22%. We anticipate to be at the lower end of this range. Thank you. And with that, let me request Nilanjan to share other updates.	3791		2	 We are encouraged by the immense confidence and trust that clients have in us.

683	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Thanks, Salil. Good evening, everyone and thank you for joining this call. Let me start by wishing everyone a very happy and safe 2023. Q3 was another quarter of resilient performance. Our revenue grew by 13.7% year-on- year and 2.4% sequentially in constant currency terms, despite seasonal weakness. Most of our business segments and geos grew in double digits year-on-year in constant currency. Specifically, manufacturing grew by 36.8%, EURS by 25.9% and Europe grew by 25.3%. Digital revenues constitute 62.9% of total revenues and grew by 21.7% year-on-year in constant currency. Core revenue saw another quarter of growth reflecting the accelerated client focus on cost take-out. Client metrics continue to remain strong with year-on-year increases in client counts across revenue buckets. Number of $50 mn clients increased by 15 to 79, number of $200 mn clients increased by 5, while number of $300 mn clients increased by 3 over  the same quarter last year, reflecting our strong ability to mine top clients. During the quarter, we added 134 new clients. Utilization, excluding trainees, reduced to 81.7%, reflecting seasonality and employees joining the bench post completion of their training. On-site effort mix remained stable at 24.5%. Quarterly annualized attrition continued to trend downwards and reduced further by another 6% during the quarter. This is the lowest quarterly annualized attrition in the past seven quarters. Consequently, LTM attrition reduced to 24.3% as compared to 27.1% in Q2. We expect attrition to reduce further in the near-term. Revenue growth was 17.8% in constant currency terms over nine months FY23. Operating margin for the same period was 21.0%, in-line with the lower-end of our full year guidance as called out earlier. Q3 operating margin remained steady at 21.5%. The major components of QoQ margin movement are as follows: Tailwinds of - approximately 40 basis points due to benefits from Rupee depreciation and cross currency, offset by lower benefits from revenue hedges. - 70 basis points from cost optimization, including lower subcon. This was offset by headwinds of - 30 basis points from higher SG&A and - the balance 80 basis points due to seasonal weakness in operating parameters, higher third-party costs, furloughs etcetera. Q3 EPS grew by 13.4% in Rupee terms on a YoY basis. DSO increased by three days sequentially to 68, reflecting higher billing during the quarter. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and debt-free. ROE increased by 2.2% YoY to 32.6%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $576 mn, a conversion of 72% of net profit. YTD FCF was $1.8 bn, which is implying a conversion of 81% of net profits.  Yield on cash balances increased to 6.3% in Q3. Q3 marked the 30th consecutive quarter of delivering positive forex income despite the volatile currency environment. Consolidated cash and investments declined from $4.79 bn last quarter to $3.91 bn, consequent to $1.32 bn being returned to investors towards interim dividend and buyback. We initiated the buyback on December 7th and till date have bought back $31.3 mn shares worth ₹4,790 crores or 51.5% of the total authorization of ₹9,300 crores at an average price of approximately ₹1,531 per share compared to the maximum buyback price of ₹1,850 per share. Coming to segment performance We signed 32 large deals in Q3, which is the highest ever. TCV was $3.3 bn, the highest in the last eight quarters with 36% net new. 7 large deals were in Retail, 6 each in Financial Services and Communications, 5 each in EURS and Manufacturing, 2 in Life Sciences and 1 in Hi-Tech. Region-wise, this was split by 25 in the Americas, 5 in Europe and 2 in the rest of the world. Growth in Financial Services was impacted due to a higher-than-normal furloughs and some specific project closures. Deal pipeline continue to be strong and oriented towards cost takeout and tech/ops transformation transformation. Our competitive position in the industry as demonstrated in the past years, remains very strong. Retailers are seeing uncertainty on consumer spending as a result of high inflation, high interest rates and softer economy. However, at the same time, direct-to-consumer and digital commerce are opening up many new opportunities on the back of our growing presence in leading e-commerce platforms and also our very own Infosys Equinox. We have healthy deal flow in the Communications segment, along with continued steady pipeline. However, cost pressures and economic concerns continue on the client side impacting discretionary budgets. Energy, Utility, Resources and Services Segment reported strong growth along with healthy level of large deal wins during the quarter. The deal pipeline is strong and on increasing trend versus the previous quarter, given medium-term growth visibility.  Manufacturing segment continues to be robust, supported by healthy pipeline of deals in both traditional and new technology areas. We are helping clients across engineering, IoT, supply chain, cloud ERP and digital transformation, including helping clients accelerate their journey to the cloud. We continue to see caution around budget and spending for consumers in the Hi-tech segment, especially around discretionary spend areas. For Digital service capabilities in Q3, we have been ranked as leader in 7 ratings for our cloud services, digital engineering services and Salesforce implementation services. We have also been positioned as a major player in 7 ratings for our IoT and engineering, security and automation services. We believe, the structural levers for medium to long-term growth for the industry remains intact and Infosys is well positioned to support its customers in their transformational journey. With strong revenue performance in the first nine months of the year, the revenue guidance for FY23 has changed to 16% - 16.5%. Operating margin guidance band remains at 21% - 22% for the year. And as mentioned previously, we expect to be at the lower end of the range. With that, we can open the call for questions. Moderator Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. It looks like Mr. Katri’s line is dropped. In the meanwhile, we will move to our next question, that is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please go ahead.	6411		2	 And as mentioned previously, we expect to be at the lower end of the range.  Retailers are seeing uncertainty on consumer spending as a result of high inflation, high interest rates and softer economy. 8% in constant currency terms over nine months FY23. Good evening, everyone and thank you for joining this call.  TCV was $3.  The first question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. 4% in Rupee terms on a YoY basis.  With that, we can open the call for questions.  Quarterly annualized attrition continued to trend downwards and reduced further by another 6% during the quarter. 3 bn, the highest in the last eight quarters with 36% net new.  Digital revenues constitute 62. 7% year-on-year in constant currency.  Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and debt-free.  Core revenue saw another quarter of growth reflecting the accelerated client focus on cost take-out. 3%.  Manufacturing segment continues to be robust, supported by healthy pipeline of deals in both traditional and new technology areas. 9% and Europe grew by 25.  Let me start by wishing everyone a very happy and safe 2023.  During the quarter, we added 134 new clients.  Q3 EPS grew by 13.  We continue to see caution around budget and spending for consumers in the Hi-tech segment, especially around discretionary spend areas.  DSO increased by three days sequentially to 68, reflecting higher billing during the quarter. 9% of total revenues and grew by 21.  7 large deals were in Retail, 6 each in Financial Services and Communications, 5 each in EURS and Manufacturing, 2 in Life Sciences and 1 in Hi-Tech.  Revenue growth was 17.  We have also been positioned as a major player in 7 ratings for our IoT and engineering, security and automation services.  - Q3 EPS grew by 13.  Our competitive position in the industry as demonstrated in the past years, remains very strong.  The deal pipeline is strong and on increasing trend versus the previous quarter, given medium-term growth visibility. 8%, EURS by 25.  However, cost pressures and economic concerns continue on the client side impacting discretionary budgets.  We believe, the structural levers for medium to long-term growth for the industry remains intact and Infosys is well positioned to support its customers in their transformational journey.  For Digital service capabilities in Q3, we have been ranked as leader in 7 ratings for our cloud services, digital engineering services and Salesforce implementation services.  This was offset by headwinds of - 30 basis points from higher SG&A and - the balance 80 basis points due to seasonal weakness in operating parameters, higher third-party costs, furloughs etcetera.  Operating margin guidance band remains at 21% - 22% for the year.  Specifically, manufacturing grew by 36.  The major components of QoQ margin movement are as follows: Tailwinds of - approximately 40 basis points due to benefits from Rupee depreciation and cross currency, offset by lower benefits from revenue hedges.	behind acquisitions complete decline increase neutral cautious comparable underperformed there ranked stable fall grow changed clear strong stabilizing here negative invest unchanged confidential limited optimistic improving reported uncertain statement continue improvements deals encouraging orders mixed spend grown announcements opportunities good slowing leading said playing comments benefit started data growth won overweight right correct forecasts yes adjustments intact margins progress strengthening investments growing forecast contribute gaining below numbers improved expanding comment outperformed unclear positive declined expand over	acquisitions participate invest removed increasing undervalued website rising reported uncertain statement improvements clients building encouraging orders spend said playing dropping overweight forecasts contribute growing forecast improved comment expanding outperformed declined neutral cautious improvement fall negative here ticker remarks overvalued release dropped inc confidential money retire momentum continue figures grown opportunities solutions won bullish declining margins intact numbers changes positive stabilized history expand complete answered underperformed ranked changed reference weakening today expanded deals mixed changing good follow leading data private rankings right rise progress report bearish announced closed over welcome behind decline drop increase missing stable grow clear strong stabilizing show unchanged limited improving announcements benefit comments active started correct adjustments announcement strengthening weak below resumed retired unclear payment

My question was around the increase in cost of software packages, that is up by almost $69 mn sequentially. How should we think of this cost, do you think this incremental $69 mn will be a sticky number out there or do you think it’s sort of representing the headwind -- instead come-  off going forward? And is this sort of a pass-through in nature, that is the second sort of clarification on the same thing? Thank you.	479		2	Hi, good evening and thank you for the opportunity.

Can you at least qualify how much of the strength was on account of share gains, which you guys have made, versus the resilience, which is there on the technology spend? Because if you look at the broader market commentary, and you have also highlighted retail as one of the weaker areas, whereas you got seven large deals in retail.

703	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 I think the large deal momentum for us is really a function of what we have seen that we have put in place, we still, within this mix of $3.3 bn, have digital transformation deal, and we have cost efficiency automation deals. What we mean by some of the industry callouts, for example, retail or telco, is, there are some clients, it is not everyone in that industry, but there are some clients which are getting impacted by the economic environment. We have been quite focused, we have a broader portfolio. So for example, you saw that in retail, we have those large deals there, it is a mix between transformation and cost efficiency automation. And so many times when clients feel an impact of the economic environment, there might be a greater need for the cost efficiency play as well. So we are ensuring that both of those engines continue to work well with our clients.	877		1	 So for example, you saw that in retail, we have those large deals there, it is a mix between transformation and cost efficiency automation. 3 bn, have digital transformation deal, and we have cost efficiency automation deals.

Can you just help us with the -- what are the pools which you are seeing on profitability, given that the supply scenario is easing rapidly? Is there some portion of the pressure which is on account of the higher share of cost efficiency deals, which you guys are winning with initial ramp-up cost?  Because if you look at Q4, obviously, Q3 also had the pass-through business, which got impacted. I'm assuming, as Nilanjan mentioned, there was some seasonality into that.	601		2	And another question was on the margin side.

705	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes. So I think like we mentioned, the reason for Q3 margins, we have already given the breakdown. So as we look ahead, see the levers which we have, one is, utilization. And you have seen at 81.7% - this is probably, I think, one of the lowest in the last three to four years since I've been here. So that is one lever which we will have. And as we start putting these freshers onto the production floor, you will automatically get a pyramid benefit. So that will be a double value benefit for us. We also have subcons today, we have dramatically reduced our subcons literally in three quarters. We were 11% plus, we are at 8.7%. Historically, we have been at 7%. If you look at our pricing, it has been quite stable. And historically, this is one lever which always used to drag down, repeatedly, due to discounts on renewals, et cetera. And as of now, we have not seen that at all. We continue to push with clients on where all we can get price increases. Automation – in terms of our own workforce continuing to operate that and that is a steady lever which we have. So we are continuing to use these levers as we look ahead, and we will continue to deploy them.	1167		0	 We continue to push with clients on where all we can get price increases. 7% - this is probably, I think, one of the lowest in the last three to four years since I've been here.

And many forward-looking indicators like deal wins, pipeline and CIO surveys still continue to be very strong, even 11, 12 months into this macro concerns.

And we are also seeing that the opportunities for cost optimization and efficiency are expanding within the work that we are doing. So in many ways, we are in a good position to be able to work on both sides. And so while it is difficult to predict what the way the situation in the economy will evolve, we feel quite balanced. Our sales team is quite agile. We have pivoted quite quickly and developed various points of view on different efficiency scenarios in different industries that we feel comfortable that the pipeline is looking good at this stage, and we will continue to work on that.	854		2	 And we are also seeing that the opportunities for cost optimization and efficiency are expanding within the work that we are doing.

713	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Sudheer Guntupalli 	 Sure. Thanks Salil. All the best for the future. Moderator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Moshe Katri Thank you, and happy New Year, and congrats on strong execution in a pretty tough environment. I have a three-part question. First, March guidance upgrades is pretty unusual from a seasonality perspective and given the macro concerns. So it seems like you have better visibility, now, can you share any views on the budget cycle itself? We were kind of concerned over slippages, maybe a month or two, budget delays. Are you seeing any of that or you think that budget will be awarded or finalized as on time this time?	693		2	 Are you seeing any of that or you think that budget will be awarded or finalized as on time this time.

714	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Moshe. On the budget, so far, we have seen, in some clients and especially in the industries we have called out, some areas where there has been slowness in deciding or some changes, especially on some discretionary work. So we mentioned hi-tech, for example or mortgages or bank, investment banking. So all of those ones that we mentioned before. But we don't see a broad-based change. Equally, we do see good behavior with the budgets moving ahead as in the past, with energy, utilities, manufacturing. So, it is not like one answer that it’s a little bit by industry or sub industry somewhat different.  Moshe Katri Understood. And then you, in the press conference, you mentioned that about a 1/3 of your new or 1/3 of TCV came in from new logos. Can you remind us, is this within the range of what you've seen in the past in terms of mix of new logos versus renewals?	880		2	On the budget, so far, we have seen, in some clients and especially in the industries we have called out, some areas where there has been slowness in deciding or some changes, especially on some discretionary work.

That is in the range where we do - some quarters it's lower, some quarters higher, but these numbers are not unusual. Moshe Katri Okay. And then the final question is for Nilanjan. When we met in Bangalore back in December, you pointed to pivot in the nature of the new deals flow towards, as you said, cost optimizations and vendor consolidation. Obviously, this is what you're seeing. Are these deals typically less dependent on clients' budgets, given the fact that you're taking over a specific function with the objective of reducing delivery costs? And is there any difference in profitability levels here in terms of these projects versus some of these projects that you've been doing in the past few years? Thank you.	788		0	 When we met in Bangalore back in December, you pointed to pivot in the nature of the new deals flow towards, as you said, cost optimizations and vendor consolidation. 3 bn, there was 36% net new.

716	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 So in that, I think the way you described it, these are not fully correlated with the budget of a client. In many instances these are areas where given the evolving economic situation, clients are looking to reduce their tech spend across the enterprise, in many cases, use some of that savings to fund transformation programs. It sometimes gets coupled with vendor consolidation. So let’s say – there are clients who may have five or six vendors and when we benefit from the consolidation we see tremendous efficiency that can be created. Our automation tools become quite useful. We typically add automation on our ongoing programs, which give an annual benefit. But when we see something of scale where we have not been involved earlier, we have an ability to provide a much greater benefit. In aggregate, the profitability of these deals is within the range of the rest of our company and especially has been more-and-more over time  leverage the automation tools and our capabilities, we see these becoming stable high profit deals. Moshe Katri That is very helpful. Thank you. Moderator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from CLSA.

Ankur Rudra Hi, thank you and congratulations on strong headline numbers there. I'm going to try Pankaj's question in a different way. You mentioned in previous calls that the mix of deals was changing in favor of smaller deals. And that is why the headline, TCV was declining, but growth was still quite healthy. This time, of course, both have done well.

But just looking backwards, we see the mix of deals remaining in good shape across the board. There are some quarters in which there are disproportionate number of larger-sized deals. But in general, we do not have a pattern in that, at least that is evident in Q3 here. Ankur Rudra Okay. All right. The next question I wanted to check, Salil, again, was on the US business. The headline growth seems to sort of slipped down to close to low double digits, whereas the Y/Y growth has been led by very strong performance in Europe and manufacturing. Do you worry about the US business it is sort of slower than Europe it is not the case in the rest of the industry then many of your peers?	777		0	 But just looking backwards, we see the mix of deals remaining in good shape across the board.

Europe, of course, has been a standout in the growth that we  have had. We feel the traction, the pipeline, the work remains pretty strong, as we have described earlier, across the two dimensions, transformation and cost, across the geographies. If you look at the economic situation, we do see the European side a little more impacted, but we see good traction on the pipeline on both sides. We had a very successful Europe program over the last 18, 24 months, and that is also helping us with the growth in this quarter.	634		2	So there, Ankur, our view is, we have had very strong growth in the US at over 10% in Q3 in constant currency.

So we always see that the initial part of the deals will be lower-than-portfolio margins. But like we have shown in the past, at the same time, our existing deals are reaching higher profitability, and that offsets some of this pressure which is coming from the newly signed deals, where the margins will typically be lower.

One, I wanted to basically get an idea on -- I mean you've seen attrition coming down in this quarter quite sharply. And as you mentioned in your opening remarks as well, so how do you see the trend of this attrition going forward, of course, downwards? And how do you believe the benefit of this could actually percolate to our margins? Again, not asking for objective guidance of a number. But in terms of the direction, do you think it is going to aid our margins? Or do you think most of the impact of this is already built into the numbers that we have currently? And my second question was majorly on the geography of Europe. So just wanted to pick your brain on how the conversations with the clients are happening in that part of geography, specifically if you could maybe break up between Continental Europe, Eastern Europe and in the UK? And which pockets of those geographies do you think are looking more softer? Or is there more of delayed decision-making in that part of the geography?	1131		1	 Again, not asking for objective guidance of a number.

And like we said, even in the future in the next quarter, at least until -- what we are seeing the latest initial figures we are seeing this coming down. Absolutely, this should have a positive impact on margins. I mean, during the year, whether it was stretched hiring on laterals, whether it was the compensation hikes we did, that really impacted our year-on-year margin story.  So as looking ahead in attrition, as an impact both the macroeconomic and also the internal policies we are doing in terms of promoting within, etcetera, should benefit us.	646		2	 So as looking ahead in attrition, as an impact both the macroeconomic and also the internal policies we are doing in terms of promoting within, etcetera, should benefit us.

But I mean, it may vary from quarter to quarter, you could have some quarters which are up. But there's nothing to say that in the long run where this is going. It's a bit early to say that.

761	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	  Thanks, Rishi. Good afternoon, and welcome to everyone who is here on the campus and everyone who is joining us online. We are delighted to share with you that our Q3 performance was strong, with year-on-year growth of 13.7%, quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.4% – this in a seasonally weak quarter for us and amid a changing global economy.  We continue to take market share. We continue to benefit from consolidation. Growth in Q3 was broad-based, with most industries and geographies growing in double digits in constant currency. Our large-deal value was at $3.3 bn, the highest in eight quarters. With 32 large deals, this is the largest number of large deals in a quarter in our history, 36% of this is net new. Our pipeline of large deals remains strong.  Our digital revenues grew at 22% in the quarter at constant currency and are now close to 63% of our overall revenue. Our core services revenue grew as well at 2.4%.  We are seeing growth in both areas of our business – digital and core services. This is a testament to our industry-leading digital capabilities, including our Cobalt cloud capability and our industry-leading automation capabilities, both of which are resonating with our clients.  Our large-deals pipeline is seeing increased traction for automation and cost-efficiency programs. Strong growth was accompanied by stable operating margins at 21.5%. This was driven by healthy revenue growth and cost optimization benefits. Our voluntary quarterly annualized attrition continues to decline. It was reduced by 6 percentage points sequentially to well below 20% for this quarter.  While we are encouraged by the immense confidence and trust our clients have in us, the signs around are showing a slowing global economy. Some areas such as mortgages and investment banking in the Financial Services industry, Telco, Hi-Tech, and Retail are more impacted, and that is leading to delays in decision-making and uncertainty in spending in these areas. We are confident that the strength of our digital and cloud capabilities and our automation capabilities will continue to position us well in this market. We are keeping a close watch on the global economy.  Our operating model and offerings are agile to deliver value for our clients in this evolving macro environment. Driven by a growth of 17.8% in constant currency for the first nine months of FY'23 and the strong large-deal value for Q3, we are increasing our revenue growth guidance, which was at 15% to 16%, we are increasing it to 16% to 16.5% for the full financial  4 year, despite the changing global conditions. We are retaining our operating margin guidance for FY '23 at 21% to 22%. We anticipate to be at the lower end of this range. Thank you.  With that, Rishi, let's open up for questions. 	2783		2	 We anticipate to be at the lower end of this range.

763	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Ritu Singh 	  Hi, thank you, you said you have increased your revenue growth guidance despite changing global conditions. What gave you this confidence? Why the revision up? What about furloughs, were they lower than what you were expecting from your comments in the last quarter?  Also, we have seen a significant rupee depreciation during the quarter, and yet the margins have more or less remained flat. What is the reason for that? And any visibility you have on the FY'24 growth? Because you are talking about this difficult macro environment and yet you revised up your guidance. So, what are you hearing from clients in terms of their budgets? And these large deals that you say continue to be strong in the pipeline, are you seeing more renewals or newer deals that you expect to win?  And a word on attrition and hiring as well – do you expect it to continue to trend lower? I think it is the lowest in the last five quarters. And also, hiring is lower than the previous quarter – is it because you are anticipating lower growth? Any comment on that as well? 	1056		0	 I think it is the lowest in the last five quarters.

764	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	  Thanks for the questions. I will try to get through most of them. On some of the points on margin, Nilanjan will jump in as well.  On the guidance, our focus is really on what we see as we closed out the quarter. We had exceptionally strong growth QoQ 2.4%, YoY 13.7%, for the first nine months, we are at 17.8%. Then we had very strong large deals. At $3.3 bn, it is the largest we have had in eight quarters. And the number of deals is also a testament to the environment for us, at 32 deals, it was very strong. Given all of those factors, we saw that it was right to increase our guidance.  The point we made also is we do see that there are changes in the economic environment. We have called out, for example in Financial Services, beyond mortgages, investment banking; we have called out the Telco sector; we have called out Hi-Tech and Retail. But keeping all that in balance, there were some things that give us a lot of support while we see other factors in the environment changing. But keeping all that in balance, we were ready to increase our guidance.  On attrition, before we go to the margin and so on, we have seen a steady quarter-on-quarter decline for the last several quarters. We believe many of the policies we have put in place to make sure that we are more and more aligned to where our employees are focused on, is  5 helping. And of course, the overall environment is also changing in the market. So, we see attrition continuing to go down.  On FY'24, we have no comments at this stage. We will absolutely look at it at the end of the quarter in Q4. On hiring, we have the number of hiring based on what we saw on the demand, and we have also had a very strong hiring for the full year in FY'23 and also before that. And we are making sure that all of that hiring goes through our various training and is ready for deployment. 	1857		2	 On hiring, we have the number of hiring based on what we saw on the demand, and we have also had a very strong hiring for the full year in FY'23 and also before that.

765	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  Yes. So, on margins, we are at 21.5%, and that is flat sequentially. A couple of reasons, and first you mentioned about the benefits of currency. So, we got a net benefit of about 40 basis points from currency, net of our hedges. So, that was one tailwind for us. We got another benefit of about 70 bps from our cost optimization, for instance, our subcon costs, etcetera.  And from a headwind perspective, there is about 30 basis points additional spend on our SG&A. And the balance, about 80 basis points, was traditional seasonality in the quarter, furloughs, partly because of our third-party costs. So, these are balance, 80 bps. So that is a broad walk about a flat 21.5% margin within our guidance, as you know, of 21%- 22%. 	734		2	 And the balance, about 80 basis points, was traditional seasonality in the quarter, furloughs, partly because of our third-party costs.

Salil, the question for you is, there has been a strong execution and deal win in Q3 that led to the guidance upgrade as well. Can we extrapolate this to believe that the client budget will be robust and double-digit revenue growth will sustain in FY'24? And could you give us a bit more insight on the trends you are witnessing in Europe and for verticals like BFSI and Hi-Tech?  And Nilanjan, for you, there is a question on margin, which you just answered. A follow-on question on attrition that is coming down sharply. Could there be a sharp reversal in margins from Q4 onwards? How are the pulls and pushes stacked for margins? 	736		0	 Salil, the question for you is, there has been a strong execution and deal win in Q3 that led to the guidance upgrade as well.

767	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	  Thanks, Rishi. On the first part, I think we talked a little bit about why the margin was increased in terms of what we see in the environment. We are not commenting obviously on the financial year '24 and what the guidance or growth in that year will look like. What we do see in terms of demand environment is what I shared earlier. We see some areas, for example, the mortgages area or the investment banking area in financial services, we see some areas in Telco and Hi-Tech and some in Retail.  There is more variation we see in the European markets, more concerns on what is going on with the economy. The US market is also there, but relatively less so in the US compared to Europe. We will see how this plays out because this is not a scenario where it is the same for every industry. For example, we have seen extremely strong growth in energy, utilities, that part of our business, and we continue to see that in Q3. We saw very strong growth in manufacturing, and we continue to see some of that traction in our business in Q3.  6 	1044		2	 We are not commenting obviously on the financial year '24 and what the guidance or growth in that year will look like.

769	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  Yes, so absolutely. So one is, of course, as you know, if you have seen our utilization, in fact, that came as a headwind for us. We have built a large, fresher pipeline. They go through our training, like Salil mentioned, at Mysore. And they are on bench now. We are training them, reskilling them. And in fact, that will give us some headroom, for growth looking ahead. So, the question partly about do we need to hire more, so we have a very substantial bench. And I think our utilization at about 81.7% is one of the lowest we have had. So, we have some headroom there.  Looking ahead, of course, subcon costs, we have brought them down. At one stage, we used to be closer to 7% of our revenue, we are at around 8.7%; utilization is another factor. We continue to work on pricing, onsite-offshore, the pyramid itself, with the freshers coming in will help us. So, these are the levers, we will have to deploy as we look ahead, in the next few quarters. 	959		1	So one is, of course, as you know, if you have seen our utilization, in fact, that came as a headwind for us. 7%; utilization is another factor.

For Salil, he wants to know, give us a sense of the demand environment in North America, UK, and Europe. And have you seen a trend of small deal sizes compared to what we saw in the last two years? Do you foresee a slowdown in deal closures?  Nilanjan, your question is again on margins, which has already been answered. So, I am not asking that again. 	466		1	The next question is from Sajeet Manghat from BQ Prime.

771	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	  On the demand environment, similar view. I think we see different demand environment in different industries. And even within some industries, there is a variation based on the client. We are also seeing much more demand today for automation, cost efficiency, operational improvement programs.  The size of the deals, as we see with $3.3 bn in large deals, we have a tremendous volume, 32 of those deals for this quarter. So we do see a change in the environment. But we see that both of our engines, the one for digital and cloud driving transformation and the one for automation driving cost efficiency, both are working and growing for us. 	645		2	I think we see different demand environment in different industries.

Europe, I think we mentioned earlier that there are differences within the European economies. We are seeing today more economic changes in the European market relative to US. But even so, there is a factor of the industry. We are seeing good traction in some industries, for example, energy utilities, and that is across geography, while we see some constraints which are in Hi-Tech and parts of Financial Services. 	491		2	 We are seeing today more economic changes in the European market relative to US.

774	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  On the pricing side I think, we have seen a much more stable pricing regime than what we have seen historically. And part of that has been the high inflation we have seen in these economies as well and also because of the compensation hike. So some of that, we are trying to work with our clients to pass that on, and we have had some successes there.  Of course, things like discounts have actually come down over the years. So, I think this is a discussion we have by each client, and I think that is something which we will continue to work on irrespective for the year ahead. 	582		2	 So some of that, we are trying to work with our clients to pass that on, and we have had some successes there.

There are parts of it, for example, mortgages and investment banking, where we are seeing some constraints on what they are doing with their business. There are other parts of Financial Services, which are not seeing those same constraints. We have places, where because of consolidation of partners, we are actually seeing some growth across some clients as well.  In terms of hiring, we have no comment today on our plans for FY'24. Those things, in any case, we will not comment on the hiring number. We will, at the end of the quarter, lay out the guidance for growth and margin for next year.

789	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  10  Yes, sure. So, I will take the second and then the first one. So, 81.7% utilization is largely because of our fresher's bench. That is the biggest reason and because we have been hiring so many freshers through the year and putting them into training. So, over a period of time, they will start going into production, because you cannot overnight put a new project and have them with all the freshers.  And like we have talked about in the past, it was an investment we are ready to make because you cannot overnight flip the model of putting freshers. And so, we are ready to make that investment and then start leading them into the production projects and rotate existing headcount. So, we are not so concerned. Over a period of time, that will start actually helping us.

Salil, for you the question is, the per employee consolidated revenue declined further to $54,000 level, down over 6% Y-o-Y. Does this show that employee costs have still remained high in the sector despite falling attrition rate? And is this something that we expect to see in the coming quarters as well?  For Nilanjan, a couple of questions. You have raised guidance for FY'23 on the back of a strong quarter. However, the number of active $100 million-plus customers reduced by one during the quarter. Is that a factor of uncertainty coming from North America and Europe? And do you expect large deals to remain muted or even decline through the next quarter? This was already asked.  And there is another question. Revenue from India saw a 5.4% Y-o-Y constant currency decline, while the rest of the world, including Europe saw growth.

807	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  Okay. So, I will start with India. So, India is a very small portion with about 2.5% of our global business is from India. And a lot of the work we do with our clients is also volume and transaction-led. So, you will see these pluses and minuses on a quarter basis on the growth figure. But like as I again said, it is only 2.5% approximately our revenue.  The second one was about the revenue per person. I think that is just a reflection of our utilization over the year, which was about 88%, and now we are at 81%. So that is just the math of the overall RPP as such. So, our margins have, like I said, quarter-on-quarter, remained stable. So that’s a different way to look at the metric because we have also hired freshers during this time, who are sitting on bench and are in training in Mysore. But from a productive perspective, we have seen that utilization factor come down by only about one and a half percent during the quarter.  	943		1	 So, our margins have, like I said, quarter-on-quarter, remained stable.  But from a productive perspective, we have seen that utilization factor come down by only about one and a half percent during the quarter.  And a lot of the work we do with our clients is also volume and transaction-led. So, India is a very small portion with about 2.  But like as I again said, it is only 2. 5% of our global business is from India. 5% approximately our revenue.	acquisitions decline increase there stable grow clear invest stabilizing limited improving continue good said data revenue adjustments progress contribute improved not changes unclear positive declined	acquisitions decline increase missing there stable hired grow clear stabilizing here sales transactions added important reported improving say figures orders calculations retiring opportunities good said comments different data right correct yes adjustments progress start growing contribute numbers down improved changes unclear positive declined stabilized

809	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	  On the deals, first, the reported terms have a lot of currency in it. So, we always look at our business on a constant currency terms. We think that’s a metric, which is more stable and more indicative of how the underlying business is doing. So, the key for us there is the core is growing this quarter on a constant currency basis.  We don’t typically give out the average TCV on our deals. The reality is we have a huge large-deals number at $3.3 bn, and that makes a big difference as we look ahead into what is going on with the future of the business. On cloud deals, those really come back to what is the view of individual clients and within industries what’s happening and then the overlay of the cloud as an ecosystem. 	731		1	On the deals, first, the reported terms have a lot of currency in it.

813	\infosys\dec-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  Yes. So, I think I have answered many of those. So, we have given our margin walk on 21.5% sequentially as well.  And the other one - large deals continue to perform well. You will see our overall strategy over the last four years since the large-deal strategy was put in place. At 21.5%, we are actually well above where we started around FY'20. So, despite all the large deals, we have seen that, as we go through the deal cycles, we have seen the improvement in margins. And  15 of course, new deals come into the funnel with lower margins, but that is a mechanism we have actually mastered, and I think that is something which we do every day. 	650		2	 And  15 of course, new deals come into the funnel with lower margins, but that is a mechanism we have actually mastered, and I think that is something which we do every day.

828	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Rishi. Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us today. I trust each of you and your families are safe and well. It is wonderful to be back on our campus and also to be with Pravin and Nilanjan in person after five quarters, of course at a safe social distance. I am delighted to share with you, that we have had a landmark first quarter with robust YoY growth of 16.9% and sequential growth of 4.8% in constant currency terms. This is the fastest growth we have seen in 10 years. We continue to gain significant market share with this growth being essentially organic and especially in the area of digital transformation. This is a clear reflection of Infosys’ resilience and client relevance that has grown stronger with the unwavering commitments of our employees and our differentiated digital portfolio. I would like to thank all our employees for their incredible dedication especially during another testing period with the second COVID wave in India. Some of the highlights of our results are: 1. Our Digital business grew by 42% YoY and now constitutes 53.9% of our revenues.   4 2. We had broad-based growth across all our sectors, service lines and geographies. Financial Services grew by 23%, Retail 22%, Life Sciences 21%, and Manufacturing 19%, the North America geography by 21%. 3. Our large deals were at $2.6 bn, large deals are deals over $50mn in value. 4. Operating margins were strong at 23.7%. 5. We had tremendous focus on our employees especially related to their well-being and to new talent expansion. We had a net headcount increase of 8,000 attracting leading talent from the market. We remain comfortable with our ability to support our clients in their digital transformation journey. With a strong start to the financial year, good large deals in Q1, strong pipeline, we are increasing our annual revenue guidance for growth from 12% to 14% moving up to 14% to 16% in constant currency. Our operating margin guidance remains unchanged at 22% to 24%. Let me pause here and hand it back to Rishi and then let us open it up for questions.	2078		2	 This is a clear reflection of Infosys’ resilience and client relevance that has grown stronger with the unwavering commitments of our employees and our differentiated digital portfolio. 9% of our revenues.

830	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Mugdha Variyar 	 Hi Salil, Nilanjan, Pravin. Congrats on a very strong quarter. What a start to the fiscal year, your strongest growth in Q1 in a decade and Salil, let me come to you then. Is it the growth in Q1 that has given you the confidence to increase your revenue guidance and that too much higher than what a lot of the street was expecting and if you can tell us a little bit about your deal wins, the pricing that you are seeing now in the market and the tenure? And while your digital growth has been really strong, the core business seems to have degrown YoY. If you can tell us what is the weakness there in the core business? Nilanjan, let me come to the point about margins with you. If you can tell us what was the margin pressure which led the margins to be lower than what the street was estimating and going forward as well, you have called out a few headwinds when it comes to margins, if you can elaborate on that especially around talent   5 retention, etc. And Nilanjan, a specific question about the India business because we did see that TCS had called out the impact from the India business. For Infosys the India revenue share is about 3%, I think, it has come down to 2.9% in this quarter. Did you see any impact of the second wave as part of your India business? Pravin, again on attrition, you did say that you will be hiring a lot of freshers etc., but when do we see the next salary hike, what will be the quantum of the salary hike and if you can just throw some light on the challenges you are facing now in terms of the supply side, given that you are seeing strong demand. And Pravin, of course lastly, I have to ask you about the income tax website issue, if it has been completely resolved, because the Finance Minister was in Bengaluru just two weeks ago, and she said, a few issues were still unresolved, if you can throw some light on that? Thank you.	1876		0	 Did you see any impact of the second wave as part of your India business.

831	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Mugdha for the questions. Let me start off. I think in terms of what we see in the market, the growth of course was very strong in the first quarter as you noted, we also see a good pipeline from where we are working with clients. We see that the digital transformation approach that our clients are looking for is something that we can support them with quite well and we also saw a good large deals numbers and wins in Q1. When you put all of that together, that gave us the confidence to increase our revenue growth guidance at the end of the first quarter. In terms of the pricing that you mentioned, we see the pricing to be reasonably stable. We do not see any real constraints in it at this stage or any differences from what we have seen in the past. Let me now pass it to Nilanjan.	799		2	 We see that the digital transformation approach that our clients are looking for is something that we can support them with quite well and we also saw a good large deals numbers and wins in Q1.

832	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 So, the first question, Mugdha you had on margins, as you know, that last year we ended at 24.5%, and we had called out that there were a lot of one-off benefits we had received during the year. Some of them were discretionary in nature, like travel came off, facilities and other discretionary spends have been cut down and of course some expenses were deferred, things like salary hikes and promotions etc., and therefore when we called out our guidance for FY22 we had actually factored all that in and said it is going to be 22% to 24% versus a 24.5% of last year. Please keep in mind also the pre-pandemic sort of guidance was 21% to 23% so this was a step up as well from a guidance operating range and in 23.7% we are at the top end of that guidance. Having said that on a sequential basis, if you’ve seen, our margins are down from   6 24.5% to 23.7%, out of that we have got about a 10 basis points benefit of currency, we have got about 40 basis points benefit of utilization and this was offset by about 50 basis points of subcontractor and third party costs as demand has really ramped up and we have taken up subcontractor to fulfill the demand, and about balance 80 basis points is a combination of various employee-related costs whether it is retention, hiring, promotions, etc. So that is the broad margin walk on a sequential basis. We remain very, very confident in our 22% to 24%, band, we have a lot of operating levers on taking out costs, so that is a comfort zone for us. Your second question on India as mentioned, yes, India is a very, very small portion for us and I think both from a demand and a supply side, we have not seen any impact. I must call out the fantastic and dedicated work done by all the employees across the globe to ensuring that we are able to fulfill our demand during these trying times as well. In that sense India really didn’t impact us. Over to you Pravin!	1909		0	7%, out of that we have got about a 10 basis points benefit of currency, we have got about 40 basis points benefit of utilization and this was offset by about 50 basis points of subcontractor and third party costs as demand has really ramped up and we have taken up subcontractor to fulfill the demand, and about balance 80 basis points is a combination of various employee-related costs whether it is retention, hiring, promotions, etc. So, the first question, Mugdha you had on margins, as you know, that last year we ended at 24. 5% to 23. 5% of last year. 5%, and we had called out that there were a lot of one-off benefits we had received during the year.  Having said that on a sequential basis, if you’ve seen, our margins are down from   6 24.  and therefore when we called out our guidance for FY22 we had actually factored all that in and said it is going to be 22% to 24% versus a 24.  Your second question on India as mentioned, yes, India is a very, very small portion for us and I think both from a demand and a supply side, we have not seen any impact.	estimates decline increase underperformed there clear done invest reference pay unchanged money reported statement continue figures spend good said comments right correct yes margins progress contribute struggled down not unclear positive over	acquisitions decline selling increase underperformed there concerned grow clear done strong stabilizing reference guidance invest pay unchanged confidential help reported improving statement continue figures spend opportunities good benefit saying said comments right correct forecasts yes adjustments margins progress that forecast contribute comment down not changes unclear positive declined over
833	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 Thanks, Nilanjan. Your first question was on attrition. Attrition for IT services that is voluntary attrition on an LTM basis has increased to 13.9%, it was 10.9% earlier. In some sense it is an area of concern, but at the same time, it is also a reflection of high demand environment out there, and shortage of supply. We expect this situation to continue for a couple of quarters till supply catches up. From our own perspective, as Salil mentioned, we have been able to backfill attrition as well as we had a net hiring of 8,000 this quarter. It is a clear reflection of the kind of brand that we have and the ability to attract the right talent. We will continue to focus on that. We have increased our campus hiring or the fresher hiring to 35,000 globally. We have already recruited more than 10,000 in this quarter, and we are also doing several other interventions. We already had one compensation increase in January and the second one is effective July we will be rolling it out. We have increased the number of promotions. There is a significant focus on retention there is lot of employee engagement initiatives, lot of focus on career growth, career opportunities for people and so on. So, this is something we will continue to do so and hopefully, over the next couple of quarters we should be able to come to terms with high attrition. Your second question was on the income tax project. We are working hard to address all the issues raised with respect to the portal. Many of the issues raised around performance and stability have been addressed. With the result today, on an average we have 8-10 lakh people   7 signing on to the portal and doing various activities. Many of the new functionalities like e- proceedings, TDS returns, some of the statutory forms and ITR, too, have been released. Today, we have about 10 lakhs ITRs filed so far. Yesterday, we had about 1 lakh ITRs filed in a single day. We have about 1.6 lakhs DSP registrations, we have close to 2 lakhs statutory forms filed, we had 31,000 e-proceedings response submitted. We have been able to address about 63.5 lakhs Aadhar-Pan linking requests and so on. So, as you can see, we have made some progress, but having said that we still have some ways to go. We have to address some of the intermittent issues we continue to face in some of the functionalities that are available. At the same time, we also have to rollout new functionalities as well. We are working very collaboratively with the Income Tax Department as well as other stakeholders. And it is our endeavor to address all these issues as expeditiously as possible. We have also added more bandwidth, we have invested in much more leadership, and I want to assure that this is the single largest priority for us today and we are hopeful to address the remaining concerns as well, as we roll out the remaining functionalities in due course.	2891		2	6 lakhs DSP registrations, we have close to 2 lakhs statutory forms filed, we had 31,000 e-proceedings response submitted.

So, as you can see, we have made some progress, but having said that we still have some ways to go.  And it is our endeavor to address all these issues as expeditiously as possible.  We have been able to address about 63. 9% earlier.  So, this is something we will continue to do so and hopefully, over the next couple of quarters we should be able to come to terms with high attrition.  With the result today, on an average we have 8-10 lakh people   7 signing on to the portal and doing various activities.  In some sense it is an area of concern, but at the same time, it is also a reflection of high demand environment out there, and shortage of supply. Attrition for IT services that is voluntary attrition on an LTM basis has increased to 13.  Your second question was on the income tax project.	priority behind complete decline increase neutral missing registration underperformed there answered stable concerned grow changed clear strong invest fall resigned important website confidential rising unchanged limited money reported statement continue improvements expertise good follow saying said comments right responded correct filings yes adjustments progress partners contribute requests not changes open unclear positive declined history over	leave hires invest effective removed pending rising reported uncertain appeal statement improvements orders involved concerns said forecasts working claims contribute satisfied comment expanding declined neutral hired fall done here ticker remarks resigned release help confidential sense money continue figures opportunities saying valid yes declining intact not changes positive complete answered underperformed attrition concerned statements changed important significant expanded success focus mixed good right filings progress investments filed announced launched over behind decline increase missing there grow clear unchanged improving layoffs retiring comments active responded correct adjustments below unclear

Salil, the deal momentum has been fairly strong, what is the kind of nature of deals that you have seen during the quarter, give us more color on that? Are there more large and small deals and also what is the kind of momentum that you have seen across the verticals and geographies in terms of the deal momentum? Secondly, talk to us more about the opportunities that you are seeing on the M&A front. Pravin, my question to you is that Infosys has retained a 22% -24% margin band and you did mention that you have a good amount of margin levers there and hence the confidence on the margin front despite several headwinds. So, what are those operating levers that you have in terms of margin defence. And one more question to Salil is, what is the kind of market share gains that you have seen so far and what is the outlook ahead on the market share gains for you?   8	993		2	 Salil congratulations firstly for a very strong quarter and to the entire team.

836	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Poonam. I think starting off first with the discussion on the deals, it is a mix of deals in our large deals portfolio with mid-size and larger deals. We see a good pipeline, we see good ability to convert. The type of work really comes from areas which are focused on data and analytics, a lot of work in the cloud side and there is also more and more work that we are seeing, which is a core functionality, a core set of actions, and converting, modernizing them into much more digital capabilities. In terms of the sectors, we are seeing a good traction from the growth numbers across several of our sectors, in fact, all of our sectors have grown very nicely. But there is good deal pipeline also in what we see in financial services, in retail, in manufacturing, in life sciences, so those are sectors, utilities, where we see a good deal pipeline as well. Before Pravin takes the other question, I will come back to the third one. On M&A our thinking is quite similar to what we have shared in the past- which is, first our focus is to look at things which help us accelerate what we are doing in digital. That is what our clients are looking for. Digital comprises of all of the elements, the Cloud, the IoT, the Cybersecurity, the data and so on, so those are areas we continue to look for and since there is a fit in terms of culture, there is a fit in terms of what we think we can do with the integration and then there is a fit in terms of how the value gets aligned. So those are really the same parameters and approach that we continue to look for in acquisitions. Pravin over to you.	1606		2	 On M&A our thinking is quite similar to what we have shared in the past- which is, first our focus is to look at things which help us accelerate what we are doing in digital.

837	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 On the margin levers, we have several levers. First one is driving higher efficiencies through adoption of lean and automation. This is something we have been doing for the last two years and there is still much more runway there. The second one is in the area of pyramid, role ratios and pyramid organization. Again, there are huge opportunities still left there. Third area is in pricing, particularly in the digital side, so that is an opportunity for us to drive higher pricing. These are in my mind some of the critical things. Right now, there are other levers which are probably optimized like typically utilization is a lever, but we are already highly optimized there, so there is not much scope in the short-term. Likewise, onsite-offshore ratio is also highly optimized, but three or four other levers which I talked about are some of the levers that are available for us to drive higher margins and we are extremely comfortable with the guidance of 22% to 24%.   9	977		2	 This is something we have been doing for the last two years and there is still much more runway there.

What improvements are we seeing in the digital business and the cloud business? Question for Pravin - the wage hikes that have happened, is there a timeline in FY22 and what possible impact it could have on the margins given that travel is resuming, and the out-of-pocket expenses might increase.  There is one more question - what are the hiring trends you are seeing? Your peers are doing extraordinary hiring and we are seeing a good growth momentum in the IT pack as well – can you please share your perspective on the same?	684		2	 Your peers are doing extraordinary hiring and we are seeing a good growth momentum in the IT pack as well – can you please share your perspective on the same.

840	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thank you, Sharad. We very much see the demand which is focused on digital and cloud areas. Digital, itself grew at 42%. We also have our Infosys Cobalt set of capabilities, which has seen more and more traction with our clients, and we continue to expand that set of capabilities, we continue to build out more industry specific solutions and more artifacts which are being used by our clients as they look at their cloud journeys. Those are areas which are most in demand. The other side that we see - where there is a focus on operations and technology coming together and doing a complete transformation from a client’s business perspective and that is driving how it impacts their end customers or their employees or how they interact with their partner ecosystem. Those are places where we are seeing more and more traction. So overall the demand outlook looks quite good, and the pricing looks quite stable at the start of this financial year. Pravin, over to you.	972		2	 The other side that we see - where there is a focus on operations and technology coming together and doing a complete transformation from a client’s business perspective and that is driving how it impacts their end customers or their employees or how they interact with their partner ecosystem.

We also announced the second round of increments which will be effective July of this year, so that is already underway. That is the compensation plan, and it is already factored in our   10 margin guidance. Likewise, any increased travel due to relaxation on the COVID guidelines and so on, all those things have already been factored in from a margin perspective. In terms of hiring, we are looking at about 35,000 college-graduate hiring globally. We have already hired 10,000 this quarter and we will hire the remaining 25,000 over the next three quarters. We will continue to hire laterals as we have been doing in the past in addition to the college graduate hiring.	769		1	On the compensation front, we did the first round of increments effective January of this year.

843	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Sajeet Manghat 	 Good set of numbers from your end. Salil, my question to you, in FY21 we saw you gathering nearly $14 bn of deal and $2.6 bn in Q1 of this year. Can you give us an idea of where is this deal coming from? Which regions this is coming from and what is the kind of pricing pressure that you may be facing here. Because even though deals are coming in at a much higher rates, we are not able to see that translate into higher margins and your margins are dependent on your domestic levers and efficiency levers, which are there, that is one question? For Nilanjan, you spoke the fact that you have wage hikes coming in. Can you give us an idea of when the discretionary spends with respect to travel and marketing expenses is kicking and if that kicks in, by what quarter we could see that impact coming into the EBIT margins going forward? For Pravin, a sense of some of the verticals how they are doing – BFSI, retail, and communication, are we seeing large deals coming in from there or is this just discretionary spends which is coming in from some of the clients?	1065		1	Salil, my question to you, in FY21 we saw you gathering nearly $14 bn of deal and $2.

844	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for those questions. I will start off. I think what we see with the large deals as you shared, we had a good outcome last financial year at $14 bn, this quarter it is starting off well at $2.6 bn. We definitely see these deals being very much part of the change that our clients are looking for and that is what from our portfolio of services that the clients are leveraging. As I shared earlier, our pricing looks stable at this stage, in terms of how that translates to   11 margin as Nilanjan was sharing, last year we had several one-offs where travel had come down where we had been extremely focused on many other costs as we entered the March, April, May timeframe. Many of those costs will start going up, for example, the salary increases and many other things we have done for the employees. As that has come in, that is where we see the outcome of 23.7% in the first quarter. We still see from a deal perspective a good outlook and this 23.7% is very much within the guidance that we had shared at the beginning of the year, and we continue to have confidence that we are in that guidance. With that let me pass it on to you, Pravin.	1152		2	7% is very much within the guidance that we had shared at the beginning of the year, and we continue to have confidence that we are in that guidance. 6 bn.

845	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 From an industry perspective, we have had a broad based growth. Seven of the eight industry verticals had double digit growth except communication and two of our largest verticals FS and retail had more than 20% YoY growth on constant currency basis. And if you look at from large deal perspective, we had 22 large deal wins this quarter, out of it, nine were in Financial Services, four each in Retail and Energy, Utility, Resources & Services, two in Manufacturing and one each in other verticals. So Financial Services obviously had standout growth this quarter and this is consistent with what we have seen in the past four to five quarters we have had industry leading growth. Growth has been led primarily in US and mostly in the subsegments of banking, mortgages, wealth, and retirement services. With economy opening up, we expect demand to come back in the payment space as well. We are seeing a lot of uptick on cloud adoption, and we are seeing lot of opportunities around cloud migration, cloud management, cloud platform implementations and so on. We are well positioned as the full- scale digital transformation player in this space. We have also seen good uptick in demand in retail after a long time. With vaccination done and economy opening up in many of the major markets, we are seeing pent up demand coming to the fore. Consumers’ sentiment is turning positive. This augurs well for the retail sector. Clients are aggressively investing in accelerating their digital transformation initiatives. It is a great opportunity for us to help our clients in their omnichannel initiatives and compete with the digital initiatives. We are seeing good traction in this space as well. While CMT has been soft on a YoY basis, on a sequential basis we are seeing good growth on the back of some of the large deal wins both in prior quarter and in the current quarter. In this   12 space, there is a lot of focus on 5G, cybersecurity, edge computing, and some of the next gen technologies like IoT, AI and so on. Energy, Utilities, was one of the softer quarters and we still see some softness in travel, hospitality, and also in energy space. However, we are slowly seeing some discretionary spend come back in this space. Here the focus is more on customer service transformation, legacy modernization, smart grid initiatives and so on. Lastly, on the manufacturing, again we have had industry leading growth. We have had a tailwind of Daimler win in the previous quarter. We are doing extremely well in all the three subsegments of aerospace, automotive and industrial. Here I think we are seeing a lot of opportunities around ER&D, engineering, industrial IoT and so on. So net-net, the growth has been pretty much broad based.	2739		2	 Clients are aggressively investing in accelerating their digital transformation initiatives.

It has gone almost to 54%, so currently like in terms of the market demand which is coming up, is it more about reaching may be Accenture level because going forward I think it would more be around digital, particular contracts which we are getting in terms of deals. I wanted to get clarity on that. Secondly to Mr. Rao, I would want to ask with vaccination now happening and people coming back to office, what is the percentage are we looking at going forward permanently as the hybrid model? And finally in terms of pricing, I would like to ask Mr. Roy about the pricing part, in which vertical can we put forward a price increase given the kind of demand which we are receiving may be from the Financial Services, so which vertical is the key growth area going forward for FY 22?	876		1	 And finally in terms of pricing, I would like to ask Mr.  Parekh with regards to the digital revenue which we are having.

848	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	   13 Thanks for your questions. I think on the first one with respect to digital, what we are seeing is that with all of the capabilities that we have built, one of the examples, we discussed earlier was on Infosys Cobalt on cloud. There are many others including on what we have done with artificial intelligence, what we are doing on machine learning, where we have strengths in data and analytics. We have today across the board a leading position in 48 categories that are tracked in the digital spectrum by independent market analysts. And that gives our clients the confidence to work with Infosys and to select Infosys for their most critical digital transformation programs. Where will this go, I think at this stage we are happy with the growth of 42%, the overall percentage having become 54% and we think this will continue because the client demand is very strong for digital. Now what we have in terms of capabilities, there is high level of relevance what our clients are looking for and we are building out the capacity in terms of all of our employees working for these areas. Our reskilling is going on to support these areas. So, from that perspective, we see a good future for the digital growth.

849	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 In terms of work-from-office, today we have about 98% of employees working from home globally. In India it is much higher at 99%. In terms of vaccination as well, in India we have about close to 58% of our employees who have had at least one dose of vaccination. About 10% of the people have had both the doses, but in some of the markets like Europe and US and all, we have had a higher percentage of people getting vaccinated and we are slowly seeing the economy open up. So, we do expect in the course of this quarter some amount of increased number of people coming to office to work. So one thing is certain, that future will be hybrid, where people will have flexibility to work-from-home or work-from-office. It will depend on the people inclination, it will depend on the clients requirement and it will also depend on the nature of the product. From our perspective, we are very well equipped. In the past, we have demonstrated our ability to switch between work-from-office and work-from-home seamlessly, so we are pretty confident that we should be able to deal with this situation. It is very difficult to figure out what percentage of people would like to work-from-office or work-from-home, but only time will tell. Our efforts over the next couple of quarters will be to slowly start getting more and more people to come to office, even though it could be in a hybrid model.	1390		2	 In the past, we have demonstrated our ability to switch between work-from-office and work-from-home seamlessly, so we are pretty confident that we should be able to deal with this situation.

851	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 There, the way we see it is today, the overall demand outlook as we engage with clients is very strong. To give you an example, I was in a discussion two weeks ago with a client where they are asking us to expand the work we do with them in a material way across a variety of their programs, some of them on Digital and others on other technologies. These are sorts of discussions, me, our colleagues, who are interacting with clients are having. So we feel comfortable with the economy coming back in many of the western markets that this will continue. Of course, what we have done with the guidance is for this financial year and that is the outlook that we share with the overall change or the digital transformation that many industries are going through is quite remarkable. Many companies, which were not in the digital space, not in the online space are now shifting at a rapid speed and those are areas  where we can help and support them. Many companies that were native digital companies are also growing very fast where we can help and support them. So, from all of those perspectives today the demand looks very good.

853	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Chandra Ranganathan 	 Hi Salil, Pravin Nilanjan, qquestions for all of you. Salil, to begin with a lot of companies are talking about how the nature of contracts itself is changing. It is becoming larger, more transformative and they are now going back to the same plans getting renewals, they are getting bigger ticket size contracts and for longer durations? If you can weigh in on that? Secondly, I would also like your take on the series of internet IPOs that we are seeing in India, what you make of this new wave of wealth creation because Infosys has really been the gold standard when it comes to wealth creation for retail investors.  Pravin, a couple of questions. You gave an update on vaccination. When we spoke to you in July you had mentioned 11,000 people were vaccinated? You will place an order for 1.2 mn doses to cover all employees and their dependents. So, can you give us a sense of whether you are getting the supply? How much till date? Also, in terms of attrition, have you changed it from annualized to LTM because the number for March is different compared to what you said last time so again can you take us through why you have sort of decided to do this? One last question on ITR.You mentioned that you know it is work-in-progress but why does Infosys struggle with government projects in general in India? Is it because the scope keeps changing for these projects because we have seen this in the past with MCA 21 and GST also. So, what is really the reason for this?	1477		1	 Also, in terms of attrition, have you changed it from annualized to LTM because the number for March is different compared to what you said last time so again can you take us through why you have sort of decided to do this.  Secondly, I would also like your take on the series of internet IPOs that we are seeing in India, what you make of this new wave of wealth creation because Infosys has really been the gold standard when it comes to wealth creation for retail investors.  So, can you give us a sense of whether you are getting the supply. Hi Salil, Pravin Nilanjan, qquestions for all of you.  When we spoke to you in July you had mentioned 11,000 people were vaccinated.	behind decline increase there grow changed clear invest here money grown good benefit said comments different right correct yes change progress that contribute numbers positive over	buying behind increase underperformed happened there wrong statements changed clear invest grow here remarks money statement continue coming orders changing grown good benefit saying said comments different data right correct yes change progress announcement investments growing that contribute numbers comment not unclear positive declined history over
854	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Chandra. Let me start off there. I think in terms of the type of deals that are going on with our clients are broadly across what we see in the market. We do not see that there is a change whether it is duration or the terms of going back to the same client to extend. Our approach is much more looking at what is the objective our clients are driving and what is the impact that we can have in helping them achieve that objective. So deals are of different sizes and different durations and we have not seen a shift if I look back over the last 24 to 36 months. Of course, during the very first days when COVID started off there was a change in what people were looking at. There was a lot more focus on cost efficiency, but as we progressed through this, there is an increased focus on digital transformation and those are the sorts of deals that we are seeing today. With that let me pass it on to Pravin.    16	922		1	I think in terms of the type of deals that are going on with our clients are broadly across what we see in the market.

857	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 Chandra, on the vaccination front so far we have administered over 230,000 doses. About 120,000 plus employees have been covered. The remaining are the dependents. So this translates to about 59% of our employees having at least one single dose and about 10% of the employees having both the doses. We have already placed order for more than half a million doses. But today the issue is not about supply at least from our perspective, our issue has been about roughly 50% of our people are no longer in the cities where our DCs are. Their homes are in tier two and tier three cities and while we have tie ups with hospitals to administer vaccines for those people wherever they are required, they are also relying on vaccine available in their own regions and they are trying to get vaccinated. So from our perspective, we have not seen too much of issue with the supply. Our challenge has been how do you ensure 50% of our people who are in tier two and tier three cities get themselves vaccinated because they are dispersed across multiple cities and that is where our focus is on currently. On the attrition front, earlier we used to do quarterly annualized. Now we have moved to last 12 month basis. So the numbers I gave are comparing relative to the last 12 months basis. This is the voluntary attrition for IT services. Last quarter, it was 10.9% and this quarter it has moved up to 13.9%. The reason we have shifted is when we look at all our peers, the majority of them are using LTM criteria so we thought it is good for us to also align with what seems to be the common standard in the industry. On income tax, our focus is right now on trying to address the issues, fix it expeditiously. We have not really done a post-mortem. There will be time for us to do it much later so right now our focus is on that so at some point in time we have to really test out and figure out what   17 happened and what can we do differently. As we have repeatedly said we are really proud of all these stuff that we do for India project and the kind of work that we do. It is not a question of not wanting to do, we are indeed open to do that and we want to do it, but we definitely need to look at what when wrong here and try to address it in the future.	2252		1	 We have already placed order for more than half a million doses.

That is number one. Number two is that since a lot of these banks, etc., financial services institutions are actually setting up their own technology centers here in India or their GICs, are you actually kind of losing share of work to the GICs?

860	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your question. I think on the first one, we are seeing both on a sequential basis and on a YoY basis. This growth is the fastest we have had in over a decade, so we are extremely delighted that, that is the way our clients are perceiving us. On what some of the banks are doing as we shared in terms of setting up their centers, what we see is there is a tremendous amount of demand and especially in the banking sector but in several other sectors where also centers are set up, for example, retail, or Hi-Tech and there are projects which are done by those centers. In several cases, we actually are collaborating with the centers as they are scaling up to make sure that we support bank or retail company or others both in the western geographies as well as in India. So, today, we do not see that that is something that is taking away from the work that we are doing. There is a large amount of work that we still see that is coming straight from many of our clients and many of the projects that we do when we have centers, we collaborate with them as well.	1074		2	I think on the first one, we are seeing both on a sequential basis and on a YoY basis.

As Pravin shared, several of the functionalities are already working, there are a large number of returns that are being filed, statutory forms that are being uploaded, e-proceedings that are carrying on. And there is work done in making sure that all of the stability and the performance is coming together. We have also augmented the team and the project management. We feel all of this is moving ahead. There is some work that still needs to be done and we are confident that all of that will be done. We are working very closely with the Income Tax Department and with the Chartered Accountants Associations who have been kind enough to give their input and advice on this matter. Working jointly and collaboratively with all the stakeholders, we believe that all of these situations will be addressed in a step-by-step manner and all of the issues will be resolved.

Geography wise we had 14 in Americas, five in Europe, two in Rest of the World and one in India and 30% is net new out of this large deal win. The second one from a campus perspective as we said earlier, we are planning to recruit a total number of about 35,000 college graduates worldwide. Even in the past we have tried to look at accelerating the training duration and faster deployment for a specific set of college graduates. For instance, if someone has already been trained in computer science and if someone is a computer science graduate or someone has  advanced technology experience, in those cases we have a much condensed training schedule so that they can be deployed on projects in a much quicker way. But, for people graduating in some of the other disciplines, we continue to take about nearly three-and-a-half to four months to complete the training duration. We believe that is important to lay a very strong foundation and at the end of it, they become pretty much productive in the projects.	1210		1	In terms of large deals, we had as we said $2.

866	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Sankalp for those questions. I think you are absolutely right. The US geography, certainly many of the European markets are coming back very strongly. We see the economies opening up, through that we see a lot of demand for large programs which look at modernization, look at transformation, look at cloud or look at areas which are focused on data   20 and analytics. We do see our large deals in all of these areas and especially when things have to be brought together where all of the capabilities have to work in conjunction, those are the sorts of deals where we have a real advantage where all of our thinking and approach of ‘One Infosys’ comes together. In terms of sectors, we see continuously good demand for those sorts of activities in Financial Services, Retail, consumer products has come back nicely. We see good demand on the Hi-Tech sector and that is an area which has tremendous potential going ahead. Many of the other sectors are also in good shape, but these are especially quite strong at this time. On the second one, Pravin, you want to take it?	1079		2	The US geography, certainly many of the European markets are coming back very strongly.

867	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 I think the nature of the pandemic is, we will continue to see multiple waves because while India is expecting a third wave some of the geographies have already had the impact of the third wave and economies have started opening up. In the long run, getting majority of the population vaccinated and following safe practices at least for the near future is going to be the only solution. In the interim, the current way of working in hybrid model will probably remain true. So whatever we have been doing in the last four-five quarters in terms of hiring, working from home, those things still continue. In the past as well, between the first and second wave we had about 5% of the population come back to work, but when second wave triggered, we had most of them started working back from home, so we expect that trend to continue for some time. But our own expectation is over the next six months or so, assuming that the impact of any subsequent wave is minimal, we will probably expect maybe about 20% to 30% of the people to start coming to work-from-office. Again, this could vary from geography to geography and as I said earlier it will also depend on nature of project, client requirements, and individual preferences and so on.	1238		1	I think the nature of the pandemic is, we will continue to see multiple waves because while India is expecting a third wave some of the geographies have already had the impact of the third wave and economies have started opening up.

875	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 I think the first one, in my discussions especially with clients in Financial Services, there are different types of work that we are seeing. One is work that relates to the Financial Services companies looking to expand or get greater market share with their customer base. What we have learnt or what they have learnt through this last several quarters is when you leverage digital platforms and cloud, customer connect acquisition work becomes much more intuitive for their customers and we with our capabilities set on digital and cloud are able to support that. Another area that we see is focused on what clients in Financial Services want to do in terms of which specific partners they want to work with. We are seeing that with the extreme resilience that we have shown through the work-from-home move and even supporting clients through all of the changes in the past five, six quarters there is a tremendous benefit, and we see some discussions where we are getting more and more access to and work with some clients in Financial Services. The third area, there is a regulatory work that we see clients in Financial Services are doing and that requires more expansion and in many of those places, we are present. And the fourth is where the clients are looking to combine the operations and technology, transform the whole business, make it more efficient, but also much more digital and new age where they can engage with their employees or other customers in a more intuitive way and when that combines tech and ops again we find ourselves in the most strong position to support our clients because they see that we are able to bring everything together much more effectively as ‘One Infosys’. So, there are multiple areas in Financial Services and each sector has different aspects that we can see that help us to scale up. With that let me pass it to Pravin.	1873		2	 We are seeing that with the extreme resilience that we have shown through the work-from-home move and even supporting clients through all of the changes in the past five, six quarters there is a tremendous benefit, and we see some discussions where we are getting more and more access to and work with some clients in Financial Services.

876	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 On the attrition front, you are right. It is a reflection of the strong demand environment and in addition to that, the startup is also very attractive place for many of our employees and with more and more of unicorns out there, that sector is now also an increasing focus for some of   23 our employees. So obviously that is something we are dealing with. From our perspective, there is a two-pronged  approach - one is we are doing our best to retain people, we are trying to articulate the value proposition, the kind of investments we are doing in terms of their own career, in ensuring that they are digitally ready, future ready and so on, we are talking about the inclusive culture that we have in the organization and there are lot of other investments around employee in terms of job rotation, billing and so on, so those are some of the things we are trying to articulate and there is a lot of deep engagement and lot of focus on retaining employees. At the same time, we are also looking at attracting new talent as well. One of our biggest strengths has been our ability to recruit college graduates, train them and then deploy them in a productive manner and from that perspective we are one of the most attractive brands in the country and our ability to attract this kind of talent is very high. Even this quarter with higher attrition we have not only been able to backfill attrition, but we have also had 8,000 of net hire. So, that is the reflection of our ability to also recruit talent, upscale, train them and deploy them and further, so that is the other area we will focus on. In terms of employee’s willingness to come back to work, in some sense you are right, there is some sense of hesitancy in terms of employees wanting to return to work. Primarily most of it is around safety concerns and so on and it also varies from geography to geography. One of the things, we have realized is where people are in the same city as where our campuses are located, there I think there is much more willingness for people to come. They are looking at some kind of flexibility rather than a big bang approach and which we are also trying to do in a phased manner, but our challenges mostly for people who are no longer in tier-1 cities where our campuses are, they have gone back to their home towns which will be in tier-2, tier-3 cities there, there is a greater deal of reluctance because they are not sure whether there will be an advent of third wave, whether they have to sit back to work-from-home and so on. So I think there is a bigger deal of reluctance from that set of population. Our own sense is this requires some amount of pain management and we have to do it in a very phased manner, so our approach is to first start small 8 to 12 weeks, encourage people who are willing to come on a voluntary basis and creating that safe environment and giving them assurance, creating trust between the employees that they have a safe environment to work on and based on that learning we will fine tune it and we are confident over the course of the next three to six months we should be able to address any concerns employees have and encourage them to come back to office as required depending on the nature of work.   24	3243		2	 One of the things, we have realized is where people are in the same city as where our campuses are located, there I think there is much more willingness for people to come.  They are looking at some kind of flexibility rather than a big bang approach and which we are also trying to do in a phased manner, but our challenges mostly for people who are no longer in tier-1 cities where our campuses are, they have gone back to their home towns which will be in tier-2, tier-3 cities there, there is a greater deal of reluctance because they are not sure whether there will be an advent of third wave, whether they have to sit back to work-from-home and so on.  Even this quarter with higher attrition we have not only been able to backfill attrition, but we have also had 8,000 of net hire. It is a reflection of the strong demand environment and in addition to that, the startup is also very attractive place for many of our employees and with more and more of unicorns out there, that sector is now also an increasing focus for some of   23 our employees.  So, that is the reflection of our ability to also recruit talent, upscale, train them and deploy them and further, so that is the other area we will focus on.  So I think there is a bigger deal of reluctance from that set of population.	acquisitions increase underperformed there hired concerned fall clear invest grow here remarks increasing reported expanded encouraging layoffs opportunities good saying said comments different right correct yes adjustments progress that growing struggled contribute not unclear positive declined history over	behind acquisitions complete increase neutral missing underperformed happened there wrong answered stable concerned hired changed done clear invest here grow ticker remarks resigned increasing show added fluctuate confidential fall money reported great statement today expanded continue figures encouraging orders problems mixed layoffs grown opportunities good vary saying said left playing comments active different right correct rise yes adjustments progress investments growing struggled contribute below not unclear positive declined expand history over

Sai Ishwar Good evening just one question to Salil Sir, could you throw some light on the annual budgets because compared to last year, in the middle of last year we had the pandemic, so do you see some of those spends of your clients flowing into this year and also could you actually tell us are these spends more in the areas of cost optimization kind of deals, which might taper down once the pandemic normalizes?	524		1	The next question is from Sai Ishwar from The Informist.

878	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for the question. The way we are seeing today, first there were some constraints, as you rightly point out last year in the budget but that very quickly gave way to what you describe as the efficiency cost discussions, but there was also a discussion on what can we do to change our business in terms of becoming much more online, much more digital, much more connected, so that they could expand their own connects in the market. Today, what we are seeing is that both of those continue, there is a huge focus and through our work on automation and artificial intelligence we are at the forefront of helping our clients, be much more efficient with respect to the tech spend. There is also the focus on building out new capabilities on their side, which allow them to be more fluid in the digital online environment. Some of that is a cost, some of that is a spend for them but a lot of that is also becoming an investment for them. So, it is a different way that they are looking at technology and that is partially why we see some of the boost because once large companies look at technology also as an investment it is a completely different pool from which they are looking to do their investment and then the returns that they are looking on it in terms of market growth or business repositioning or efficiency, which is the outcome that they are getting. So those are the changes that we are seeing in the way the budgets are evolving.	1450		1	The way we are seeing today, first there were some constraints, as you rightly point out last year in the budget but that very quickly gave way to what you describe as the efficiency cost discussions, but there was also a discussion on what can we do to change our business in terms of becoming much more online, much more digital, much more connected, so that they could expand their own connects in the market.

880	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Supriya Roy 	 Hi gentlemen. I want to know what fraction of the India business in this June quarter has been coming from the government sector in the country and if you could compare that to the June quarter the previous year. I understand the pricing is not quite affected by the volatility of the macroeconomic conditions right now, but how does the changing demands of the India clients that you have now and the kind of clients that you want to have in the near future who want to retain the pricing that you have in the India market, given again the whole backdrop of COVID- 19 situation. The second question is - I want to revisit the problem statement on attrition Pravin did mention that as and when supply does catch up there will be better opportunities. So could you just elaborate on what supply catching up is he referring to there as well, and I also want to further define the problem statement with there are lot of these media reports which go onto show data that lot of these heavily backed startups in the country are paying good engineers to the tune of as much as over maybe Rs.1 Crore 11 lakhs per annum and then you have engineers with two to three years of experience earning as much as Rs.52 lakhs or Rs.53 lakhs at these heavily backed startups on per annum basis. So how is Infosys’ approach beyond fresher hiring going to capture this sort of talent pool that the startups are well positioned to train as well as go on to balance the same excellent operating margin that are currently sustaining?	1511		1	 I understand the pricing is not quite affected by the volatility of the macroeconomic conditions right now, but how does the changing demands of the India clients that you have now and the kind of clients that you want to have in the near future who want to retain the pricing that you have in the India market, given again the whole backdrop of COVID- 19 situation.

881	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Let me start off and then Pravin and Nilanjan may join in. On the India business what you mentioned, as you know, and Nilanjan was sharing earlier, India business is small part just under 3% of our revenue. We do not split out within that any of the sectors and what the percentage of that sector is, nor do we split out separately the pricing in that, suffice it to say what Nilanjan was sharing that we had a growth in all of our geographies including in our India geography in Q1. We of course, as all of us did, had an intense impact of the second wave and nonetheless our work there continued in many ways. In terms of attrition, let me start off and then of course Pravin will jump in. The thinking that we have there is we want to make sure that we do everything that we are doing, keeping   26 employees in the forefront. Pravin mentioned number of different factors that we are looking at. Of course we have done a lot of work as Pravin and Nilanjan both mentioned- with the January increase in compensation with the one that kicks in, in July one with a lot of activity on promotions, all of those things are part of work we are driving with respect to making sure that we are an extremely attractive company for talent. Again, as Pravin mentioned, and I had shared earlier we had a net hiring of 8,000 people, so we continue to make sure that we fulfill the demand that we are seeing in front of us. In terms of what you said about the startups and some of the salary points, what we see today is that we have an extremely good training environment, what Pravin referenced earlier, three to four months, we also have a career path which is long with lots of interesting projects, and we are able to attract employees into that talent mix. Of course, we also are looking at what we are doing with compensation, we are also doing things which gives special bonuses where there are digital skills involved and we work with all of our employees to make sure that holistically both from an engagement perspective, team perspective and compensation perspective and training, we are doing everything that supports them. Pravin, is there anything else that you would like to add?	2183		2	 Of course we have done a lot of work as Pravin and Nilanjan both mentioned- with the January increase in compensation with the one that kicks in, in July one with a lot of activity on promotions, all of those things are part of work we are driving with respect to making sure that we are an extremely attractive company for talent.

882	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 I think one clarification you wanted was around the supply. If you remember whole of last year, the growth for the industry was muted, people had stopped hiring and many of the campus hires’ joining date was deferred. Only in the last quarter or so, with growth coming back people have started to resume hiring and many of the deferred candidates are being asked to join the company. There is a lead time because we have to hire, we have to train them, this training could be four to five months before we can deploy them on the project. So that is what I meant supply catching up, more people we hire, college graduates, train them and deploy them in projects then when the whole situation will ease and we will be able to meet with demand in a much more comfortable way so that is what I was referring from a supply perspective. Other question on the startup, as Salil mentioned we also have couple of specialist teams, one we call power programmer and the other one is called digital specialist. We hire people into these streams that have significantly higher compensation than what we do for normal college graduate. So, that is one way of for us to attract the right talent and we deploy these people on some of the most challenging projects which are very attractive for these people as well. So   27 that is other way we tried to also try to compete and try to get the best of the candidates out there.	1411		1	 So, that is one way of for us to attract the right talent and we deploy these people on some of the most challenging projects which are very attractive for these people as well.

The first one with respect to talent, compensation, and cost as Nilanjan had shared earlier these are things that we have factored in as we look at our cost outlook for the full year, we have already worked with compensation increase, which was rolled out in January, another one which is rolled out in July, there are other mechanisms through promotions, through different approaches, which we have done on retentions and as we bring talent in. Yes, all of those are costs, but those have been factored in as we provide our guidance for the full year, which is operating margin of 22% to 24% .There are many other levers which we use as some of them that we have discussed here for example how we work with subcontractors, how we work with role ratios in pyramid, what we do in terms of digital value with our clients which will help us to make sure that the overall cost and margin equation is how we have committed and how we have forecasted in terms of the market. For the ESG, I will request Nilanjan to give a view on that please.	1065		1	There are many other levers which we use as some of them that we have discussed here for example how we work with subcontractors, how we work with role ratios in pyramid, what we do in terms of digital value with our clients which will help us to make sure that the overall cost and margin equation is how we have committed and how we have forecasted in terms of the market.

Specifically, we have also seen that supply chain for many of our clients and when we are the vendors for them, they are very interested in our ESG practices and sustainability practices. In fact in Europe, it is very common for clients to ask us about ESG ratings in global indices. So absolutely this is more and more going to be a long part and a large part in the decision making as well and I think our credentials over the last 40 years around this is very high. We have recently been rated by one of the largest Indian rating houses last month as a number one company across India in our ESG practices.	902		2	 So absolutely this is more and more going to be a long part and a large part in the decision making as well and I think our credentials over the last 40 years around this is very high. 28 As you all know we actually rolled out our ESG 2030 vision in October last year and fundamentally we realized that our sustainability has to address all stakeholders - our clients, our shareholders, our employees, the community we work in and therefore it is a very holistic ESG vision.

Shilpa Phadnis - Times of India Your offshore effort increased to 76% that is significantly higher and the recent ISG finding shows that the supply side talent crunch is not impacting the pricing of contracts, so do you think the automation is causing this  decoupling and second question is on attrition, hiring new talent and rehiring some of them and backfilling them, would mean higher cost especially when there is  a war for technology talent, if we can talk about what kind of retention measures have really worked, not just for top performers. There is also widening MRE employee gap to the management, are the benefits more skewed towards senior management and not the junior employees?

We have a program which allows us to bring in a lot of employees, that we have now set a target for 35,000 college graduates worldwide that will join us and be deployed. We also have different mechanisms which are focused on making sure that all of the employees have a much greater engagement, a clear career path, a lot more of focus on reskilling, as we move to the   29 digital skill sets, a specialized program where there are digital tags which enable employees to get specialized bonuses, compensation, projects and of course the focus that we discussed on promotions. We think all of these things help us as we shared earlier with the net increase of 8,000 employees in the quarter to demonstrate that our brand, our approach to bringing talent in is still extremely relevant and therefore we are able to fulfill what our client needs are and grow at the pace at which we are growing here.	1086		1	 We have a program which allows us to bring in a lot of employees, that we have now set a target for 35,000 college graduates worldwide that will join us and be deployed.

900	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Sandeep. Good evening and good morning to everyone on the call. Thank you for joining us today. I trust each of you and your families are safe and well.  4  I am delighted to share with you that we have had a landmark first quarter, with robust YoY growth of 16.9% and sequential growth of 4.8% in constant currency terms. This has been the fastest growth we have seen in 10 years. We continue to gain significant market share with this growth being essentially organic and especially in the area of digital transformation. This is a clear reflection of Infosys’ resilience and client relevance that has grown stronger with the unwavering commitments of our employees and our differentiated digital portfolio. I would like to thank all our employees for their enormous dedication and contribution especially during another testing period with the second COVID wave in India. Some of the highlights of our results are: 1. Revenues were $3.78 bn, which is a growth of 16.9% YoY and 4.8% sequentially in constant currency. 2. Our digital business grew by 42% YoY and now constitutes 53.9% of our overall revenues. 3. We had broad-based growth across all our sectors, service lines and geographies. 4.

901	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 Thank you, Salil. Hello, everyone. Hope you and your family are well, safe and healthy. After a period of extremely concerning medical situation caused by the second wave of pandemic, India is gradually returning to normalcy. We have been extremely focused on employee well-being, extending every possible help to overcome any medical situation of our employees. We have ramped up vaccination drive for employees and their families. And so far, we have vaccinated 58% of our employees in India with at least one shot. We saw a sustained growth acceleration in Q1 with YoY constant currency growth of 16.9%. Growth was broad-based with 7 industry segments reporting strong double-digit growth, including the two largest, Financial Services and Retail, growing more than 20% YoY. Operating parameters continued to improve during the quarter. • Utilization improved further to new all-time high of 88.5%. • Onsite effort mix reduced further to a new low of 24.1%. However, subcon cost increased by 120bps due to stronger than expected growth, high attrition and demand for niche skills.  6  We won 22 large deals in Q1, totaling $2.6 bn - 9 in Financial Services, 4 each in Retail and Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, 2 in Manufacturing and 1 each in Communications, Hi-Tech and Life Sciences segments. Region wise – 14 were from Americas, 5 were from Europe, 2 from RoW and 1 from India. The share of new deals in Q1 was 30%. Client metrics improved meaningfully with $100mn clients count increasing to 34, an increase of 9 YoY. We added 113 new clients in the last quarter. With growth coming back, demand for top talent has also increased. Voluntary last 12-months attrition increased from 10.9% last quarter to 13.9% in Q1. However, we not only backfilled attrition completely, but also added another 8,300 employees on a net basis, which is a testimony to the strength of recruitment engine at Infosys and our status as a sought-after employer. We are taking all necessary measures to enhance employee value proposition and improve both talent acquisition and retention. However, we expect attrition to be high in the near-term due to strong demand. In Q1, we on-boarded over 10,000 college graduates and for the full year, we have increased the college graduate hiring target to 35,000 globally to ensure unconstrained client deliveries. As communicated earlier, the salary revision for fiscal 2022 will kick off from July for majority of our employees. Moving to business segments. Industry-leading performance in Financial Services continued with steady increase in growth momentum aided by signings during the quarter. Growth is led by U.S., especially in subsegments like Banking, Mortgages, Wealth and Retirement Services. With the gradual opening of the economy, we are also seeing significant improvement in the Payments sector. There is visible acceleration in cloud adoption and we are working with many of our clients on cloud migration, cloud management and other cloud-related platform deals. With the combination of our domain + tech + ops + digital capabilities, we are well-positioned as a full stack digital transformation player.  7  Performance of the Retail segment improved meaningfully with both new deal signings during the quarter as well as ramp-up of previous deal wins. We are seeing aggressive investments by clients to uplift their digital capabilities. There is a huge opportunity for us to help them build omnichannel capabilities to compete with the digital native and right-size their cost structures. Clients continue to invest in analytics across supply chain, trade promotion fulfillment, personalization using new age tools that drive heavy analytics with a fraction of the cost. Communications segment performance improved compared to the previous quarter due to the combination of fresh signings and ramp up of prior won deal. With COVID accelerating the need for better connectivity, we are seeing improving deployment of 5G across the world. We are working with our customers in advanced IoT use cases and products. Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services vertical grew strong double-digits, along with impressive deal wins during the quarter. The overall outlook is improving across subsectors and geographies we operate. Clients are slowly getting back to normalized levels of discretionary spending, especially in areas involving customer experience, operational efficiency and associated legacy transformation. Cybersecurity is also becoming important with recent incidents in Energy and Utilities segments. Growth in Manufacturing segment was strong with tailwinds from deal wins in the past few quarters. Infosys grew market share through the pandemic across all sectors in Automotive, Aerospace and Industrial. We see emerging opportunities on various trends in the ER&D space resulting from increased spending on Digital in areas like Industrial IoT, Cloud adoption, IT/OT integration – making the manufacturing value chain smarter and faster. As mentioned earlier, we expect Daimler deal to start ramping up in the weeks ahead. Life Sciences segment also continued to grow at strong double-digit rates. Our recent offerings like personalized medicine solutions for complex biotherapies, commercial insights platform to help drive commercial efficiencies and digital health platform for patient engagement initiatives would help in accelerating digital adoption across pharma value chain. Share of digital to overall revenues increased further to 53.9% in Q1, with very strong growth of 42.1% YoY in constant currency terms. There is a pent-up demand to restart delayed projects, in addition to the continuation of the pandemic-related drive towards digital  8  transformation of enterprise infrastructure and customer experience. Clients have recognized that some of the adaptations they have made to their business are going to be permanent, and they are increasing their investment in digital channels and self-service products and tools. In the last quarter, Infosys was ranked as leader in 10 digital service-related capabilities across Cloud Services, Modernization, Artificial Intelligence and Supply Chain by industry analysts. With that, I will hand over to Nilanjan.	6240		2	 We are seeing aggressive investments by clients to uplift their digital capabilities.

902	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Thanks, Pravin. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining the call. I trust each of you and your families are safe and well. We are encouraged with our Q1 performance which had significant and broad-based acceleration in growth as we begin the year. At 4.8% CC growth, we clocked the highest sequential Q1 revenue growth in the last 11 years. On a YoY basis, revenue growth accelerated to 16.9% in constant currency terms, which is the highest growth in any quarter over the last 10 years. This growth is on the back of a relatively strong Q1 FY21 performance, which was the peak of pandemic-induced revenue impact. Operating margin for Q1 was 23.7% and increased by 100 basis points over Q1 FY21, while being 80 basis points lower compared to Q4 FY21. The major components of the sequential movement were: • 10-basis-point benefit due to currency movement, • 40-basis point benefit due to increase in utilization These benefits were offset by • 50-basis-point impact due to increase in subcon and third-party costs, and • 80 basis points impact due to costs primarily related to employee hiring, promotions, retention and well-being costs. EPS grew by 26.1% in dollar terms and 22.6% in INR on a YoY basis.  9  DSOs for the quarter improved by one day to 70 on the back of robust collections. Consequently, free cash flow continued to increase and was $863 mn in Q1, an increase of 18.5% YoY. FCF conversion stood at 122% of net profit. Driven by healthy cash generation, consolidated cash and investments was $5.076 bn, after returning approximately $1 bn of final dividend and initiation of buyback. Consequently, ROE increased to 29.3% in Q1 compared to 27.4% in Q4. I am happy to share that ROE has increased by over 3.4% in last two years, driven by a robust capital allocation policy. Yield on cash balance continued to decline, the yield was 4.9% in Q1 compared to 5.1% in Q4 and 6.1% in Q1 last fiscal. Now let me talk about the progress made on the buyback plan. We initiated share buyback on June 25 after securing shareholder approval during the AGM on June 19. Out of the maximum buyback size of Rs.9,200 Crores, till June 30, we had completed Rs.690 Crores or approximately 7.5% of the buyback by end of Q1. During this period, we bought back 4.4 mn shares at an average price of Rs.1,572. Till date, we have completed Rs.1,542 Crores of share buybacks and bought back 9.8 mn shares at an average price of Rs.1,569. As the pandemic situation is improving in many parts of the world and businesses slowly return to normalcy, we expect some of the discretionary costs, including travel, facilities, etc, to start normalizing in the coming quarters. In Q2, we will also rollout compensation hikes for majority of employees. With the talent market remaining heated, we are anticipating continuing costs relating to employee retention, acquisition, and well-being in the short-term. However, given our focus on structural levers to improve efficiency and cost structure, we remain confident of our margin guidance band of 22% - 24% for the full year. Driven by strong Q1 and visibility driven by deal signings, backed by robust deal pipeline, we are increasing our revenue growth guidance for the year to 14% - 16% from 12% - 14% previously. With that, we can open the call for questions.  10  Moderator Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Moshe Katri Thanks, and congrats on strong results. So, most of the questions we are getting this morning were around margins and the leverage in the model. And I guess there is a lot of focus on wage inflation that is picking up and attrition that is picking up. Maybe you can talk a bit about the levers in the model and how do we get that comfort that the 22% to 24% EBIT margin range is sustainable beyond this year? And then should we assume that I guess the second half should have maybe some less pressure on margins given some of the normalization on the bench? Is that the right way to look at it? Thanks a lot.	4128		2	 Now let me talk about the progress made on the buyback plan. 5% of the buyback by end of Q1.

903	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes. Moshe, so I think as we had given the guidance at the beginning of this year of 22% to 24% and coming on the back of 24.5% last year, I think we were clear that there would be some headwinds – we got the one-off benefits during FY21 and we had articulated that clearly in terms of travel, facility, some other discretionary costs, the deferred costs like wage hikes, promotions, etc., which were put on hold. And we had clearly said that those will be headwinds as we look into FY22, and that was really factored into the 22% to 24% margin as well. What has changed slightly is the demand which has picked up. And like I always say it is better that demand chasing supply than supply chasing demand, because in the long run, it is much better to fulfill demand as it comes. We can continue to work on our cost optimization levers and of course our guidance also goes up. We have seen these small headwinds during the year and in terms of retention costs going up, some impact on subcons. But for instance, we just announced we will take now 35,000 college graduates, that will help us to fuel the pyramid, help us in cost optimization and we continue to look at the other avenues of automation, onsite offshore mix etc. So, I think that we are quite confident on 22% to 24%. Whilst there maybe the short-term impact, but I think some of them like subcons, etc., once hiring comes back we should see some benefits there. So, I think in our overall model, we remain quite confident within the 22% to  11  24%. But like I said, I mean, the most important thing is that if demand is chasing supply, this is a situation we really want to be in rather than the other way around. Moshe Katri Understood and just as a follow-up, given the fact that digital is almost 54% of revenues, should we assume any sort of pricing power coming up from that part of the business especially based on some of the commentary you are seeing from some of the pure-play digital names out there?	1975		2	 But like I said, I mean, the most important thing is that if demand is chasing supply, this is a situation we really want to be in rather than the other way around. , We have seen these small headwinds during the year and in terms of retention costs going up, some impact on subcons. 5% last year, I think we were clear that there would be some headwinds – we got the one-off benefits during FY21 and we had articulated that clearly in terms of travel, facility, some other discretionary costs, the deferred costs like wage hikes, promotions, etc. , once hiring comes back we should see some benefits there.

904	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes. so there has been two structural impacts of the pandemic. One is, the entire workforce transformation and the ability basically to work any part of the world, whether near shore, offshore, on premise. And the other one is, the whole digital transformation impact, which is fundamental to how the consumers of our clients are interacting with them. And this is just not about mainline brick-and-mortar retail. This extends to manufacturing. It extends to financial services, insurance and I think a lot of our clients fundamentally realize that to support and fuel the spend towards new digital transformation, a lot of that can come from cost optimization, which, in a way, speaks to the offshoring trend, and COVID has demonstrated that we can fulfill this requirement from any part of the world and that savings can be fueled back into the digital transformation. So that is at a demand level, good news. Also, I think now a lot of our conversations is also navigating more towards value and the kind of value we are delivering for our clients, whether it is on the consumer side, on the retention side, it is in the supply chain logistics. And we are positioned ourselves not just about the rate card or price per hour, but about more innovative ways of pricing, where it is clearly linked to outcome - linked to results of our clients and that is the way we think in the future, this can help us in pricing. The work we are doing has just about started, and we think, over the next few quarters and more structurally, we may be able to get some tailwinds around this. Moderator Thank you. The next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS. Please go ahead.	1680		2	 And this is just not about mainline brick-and-mortar retail.

Just a follow-up to the earlier question on pricing, I noticed that you are talking about structural movements in pricing. But in the press conference, Salil has pointed out that pricing was more or less stable. I am trying to understand why we would not be seeing a better pricing environment given how strong demand is and the fact that there is a fair amount of supply pressure across pretty much every part of the digital value chain? That is my first question.	564		2	12  Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a very strong quarter and the guidance raise.

906	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Diviya. This is Salil. The point we made earlier in the press conference, the question was on how we have seen the pricing in Q1 from what we see in terms of large deals and past interactions. Your point here in terms of what is the opportunity to see some pricing power and also building on the previous question. I think as Nilanjan was sharing with you, we believe we have an extremely differentiated digital portfolio and we believe that creates a lot of value for our clients. We are active in making sure that we demonstrate and communicate that value. We will now see over time - because of the supply concern but also because of the digital value - how that translates. That is one of the strategic levers that Nilanjan has talked about - we have all talked about in the past. We feel that, among others, gives us good comfort for our guidance band, 22% to 24% on operating margin. We will see how that plays out and especially with the supply constraint, if that gives us more leverage in the future, of course, that will be reflected in what we see in the business.	1084		2	 That is one of the strategic levers that Nilanjan has talked about - we have all talked about in the past.

We saw last year the net new was significant as we look at the overall annual number.  13  The pipeline looks good and strong. There is good focus on new deals. There is also, of course, good focus on ensuring we continue where we are and expand into that portfolio. So, no visible markers to change that. We will probably look to replicate what we have done in the past few years where net new has been a critical factor. It remains something we look at proactively into the pipeline.	608		2	I think these are quarterly fluctuations.

912	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Sudheer Guntupalli 	 Yes. Good evening gentlemen. Congrats on a great quarter. My first question is to Salil. Salil, until GFC also, Infosys was holding the pole position in the IT industry in terms of growth. But the next decade has not really panned out the way one would have hoped for. Again, over the last couple of years, even before the start of COVID and, of course, after the start of the pandemic as well, Infosys has been outperforming competition on growth and that too by a wide margin. And you have been confidently talking about market share gains from  14  competition. So how confident are you on sustainably driving the company to the pole position once again over the next decade?	679		2	 And you have been confidently talking about market share gains from  14  competition.

913	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your question. I think the way we are looking at this is, this growth, 16.9%, 4.8% is really the fastest in the past 10-11 years. It is essentially organic growth. We feel extremely good because that is a good metric. The clients are preferring Infosys and that is the ultimate test in this market. So, we feel comfortable that the capabilities that we have built in our digital portfolio and this extreme dedication of our employees in a very difficult period over the last several quarters, is combining to give us that outcome. So, the focus remains on client relevance, and therefore, the outcome metric is growth. We will see how the pole position thing plays out over time.	691		2	I think the way we are looking at this is, this growth, 16.

917	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 The quarter-on-quarter view of that percentage is always a little bit up and down. What we have seen in the pipeline is significant amount of activity where clients are looking at moving on the digital transformation program as also working on areas which relate to cost efficiency, as also, we are seeing opportunities, which we have discussed in the past, of vendor consolidation. But we do not think that the timeline has changed in terms of deal movement, nor do we see some different sort of criteria in terms of the types of deals or the pricing. What is clear is with the broad economic growth in our end markets which is coming back rapidly, is allowing for many industries to go through the transformation. Companies within industries accelerating - companies which had lower digital presence are going faster to catch up and lead from, companies which already have digital presence are making sure that they maintain their advantage. So, all those things bode well for the technology spend where we are positioned quite nicely. Moderator We will move to the next question.

So, in that sense, we have a strong engine. The first one is freshers, that are followed by laterals and then, the top-up in a way is  17  the subcon. So, all the three we accelerate. Like I said, it is important to meet demand now. That is critical and the good thing is we have not let down any of our clients.

If you take the guidance range of 22% to 24%, I just wondered if you could break down what are the key drivers for the year-over-year decline from what you already reported for FY21. I am just wondering if you could break that down into the bigger pieces. What I am really trying to understand is how much wage inflation is impacting margins guidance for the year versus other factors such as mix and particularly of the ramping of the large new deals. If there is any kind of comments you could help us understand.

925	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Like I said, it is important firstly to go back even before the pandemic into FY20 in a way when we had given this comfort range of 21% to 23%. And as we moved into FY21, like I mentioned earlier in the call, we saw a lot of these one-off benefits. It was the discretionary spend, travel came down quite sharply, facilities costs as people started working from home, marketing, the deferral of the pay hike in the last year, the promotions. Therefore, although we were at 24.5%, we were clear at starting the guidance at the beginning of the year that this would fall with the headwinds coming up of this year, as many of these costs revert back to normal. We rolled out our pay hikes in January and again in July, both of which factored in. And therefore, our guidance of 22% to 24% versus the 24.5% was clearly reflective of these headwinds coming  18  up. I think more than once we have talked about it. As we look ahead, we have factored in both the wage hikes. Yes, wage is always the number one player in margins. We do not split out the impact of wage or deal mixes. But nevertheless, the largest impact on the margin movement on a YoY basis will be on wages. Despite this, we know we are very comfortable within the 22% to 24%. The levers which we continue to employ - automation is a massive lever in terms of our cost optimization - of taking out people from projects and redeploying them, the onsite offshore mixes. I think we are unique in creating an onsite pyramid. Historically, most IT services companies have steep onsite pyramid. Our six hubs in the U.S., near shore businesses, I think that helps us build a flatter pyramid in a way, mimicking what we have in the offshore geographies. We are going to hire 3,000 freshers from outside of India. So, all these will help us in the future in terms of taking some of the pressure out of these headwinds which are coming our way.	1894		0	Like I said, it is important firstly to go back even before the pandemic into FY20 in a way when we had given this comfort range of 21% to 23%.

My follow-up question if I could, is similar as you think about the year unfolding, do you think attrition moves lower from here or stays the same or goes up? Similarly, as you think about the onsite mix has continued to move lower, so your offshore mix continues to move higher, how do you think that unfolds through the year? Does that mix of onshore onsite stay where it is, becomes more favorable or any comments on how attrition and onsite offshore mix might move as we look toward the balance of the fiscal year? That is it for me. Many thanks.	572		1	My follow-up question if I could, is similar as you think about the year unfolding, do you think attrition moves lower from here or stays the same or goes up.

927	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 I think on the attrition, like I said, I would rather be in a situation where demand is chasing supply than the other way around. Therefore, that is fundamentally good news for the industry. I think it is important to realize that it takes time for the supply chain of the industry to catch up. Fundamentally, the net new demand can be in a way serviced through fresh accounts, right. Otherwise, it is zero sum game, my attrition is somebody else’s lateral and somebody else’s attrition is my lateral. So fundamentally, the only way this demand can be serviced is through freshers and as you know most of the freshers historically, the college campus freshers are in a way contracted six months or a year out. It is only now that as the demand has suddenly surged that we are looking at new ways of getting freshers on. In the last call, we had mentioned we  19  would take 25,000 freshers. We have upped that up to 35,000 freshers and started a completely new parallel fresher hiring program off campus. So, I think there will be some short-term gaps in terms of when the supply chain sort of adjusts itself. But like I said, this is good news, if fundamentally there is this a large exposure of demand, which you are seeing across. So, in that sense, our job is fundamentally to continue feeding this demand, whether it is through the freshers or through subcons or through the laterals and I think we have already hired 8,000 net despite the attrition in the quarter. The second part of the question, we have seen this massive change over the last three years. Firstly, it came from 30% to 27% and within one year from 27% to 24% and again we talked about it earlier in our guidance that we would probably see a little bit of this easing out as travel, etc. open up. But I think the secular trend should continue in the long run and a big impact of the COVID has been that clients have been able to see that work can be performed across the globe. It necessarily does not have to be done by their own workforce. They have seen it with us that work does not have to necessarily be performed in front of them onsite, on- prem. It can be same time zone, different locations, same time zone near-shore. It can be offshore. I think that in the long run, it is positive for the outsourcing industry. So, we think secularly this should improve. But in the short-term, there can be these stops and gaps as well. Moderator Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.	2519		2	 The second part of the question, we have seen this massive change over the last three years.

934	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Ankur, this is Salil. Thanks for the question. I am not sure I fully followed it, but to first respond then we can clarify. The way the demand environment is shaping up, which I know you see very well, is extremely strong. And our approach is to make sure that the capability sets we have built are available to our clients to help them with their digital programs and automation programs. Within that, we, at this stage, are not trying to fine-tune what part will go more or less. We see that demand as a holistic picture, and we are driving to make sure that we work with our clients in doing that. What is clear, as Nilanjan shared a little bit earlier is that we have several levers in the operations toolkit, if you can call it that, which we are deploying so that each of this tool of work, wherever they start from, are then further optimized. And that gives us the confidence because of those levers that we will land fairly clearly within the margin band. That is the approach that we have in place today. Ankur Rudra Thank you, Sir. I think part of my question, which has not been completely addressed was do you think, for example, the margins came in lower in 1Q versus what you had planned earlier and hence, you are being a bit more flexible in what you said, chasing demand as opposed to optimizing for margin?	1326		2	 I think part of my question, which has not been completely addressed was do you think, for example, the margins came in lower in 1Q versus what you had planned earlier and hence, you are being a bit more flexible in what you said, chasing demand as opposed to optimizing for margin.  And our approach is to make sure that the capability sets we have built are available to our clients to help them with their digital programs and automation programs.  We see that demand as a holistic picture, and we are driving to make sure that we work with our clients in doing that. I am not sure I fully followed it, but to first respond then we can clarify.  And that gives us the confidence because of those levers that we will land fairly clearly within the margin band.	behind complete there grow changed clear invest here remarks website confidential statement today continue good saying said comments right responded correct yes progress report contribute struggled forecast comment announced open unclear positive over	behind complete increase neutral underperformed answered there wrong clearer grow clear changed strong invest here ticker removed remarks release website confidential capacity money reported statement today momentum figures orders good saying said comments right correct yes progress contribute struggled below announced not open unclear positive over
935	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	  22  I think my sense is we had shared over the last year, and I know Nilanjan had also shared that many of the outcomes last year were onetime benefits, for example, on the travel. Of course, the onsite offshore mix has moved much more in a secular way. The fact that we reduced several other cost line items in the March, April, May timeframe last year with a different view to where things are going. So, we did not think, at least in our minds that the margin was going to be different. We started the year also with 22% to 24%, even as we closed out the previous year, 24.5% because we could see the salary increase, which we had done later than originally planned in January, the second salary increase of July, all of those were coming up. So, in that sense, we are not changing, as you call it, chasing something more because this margin has come in low. We had this view of the margin as we started the year. The demand outlook has actually become stronger. So, we feel what we started with 12% to 14% with what we are seeing in the way these deals are working, and there is a lot of activity where clients are coming to us. To give you one example, two weeks ago, I was in a client discussion where they want us to expand what we do within that client portfolio. Within this one client, it could be 30%, 40% expansion, and these are just anecdotal, which add up. And my colleagues, all of our sales team are having those sorts of discussion. So, that gave us the confidence to increase the growth guidance - not that we are chasing something more because the margin was lower than what we expected. Ankur Rudra I appreciate the color. Just one follow-up, if I can, the supply situation that you are facing in the market, which you elaborated on, do you think that had any bearing on the signings in the quarter, that is part one. And part two is, is the supply situation having an impact on client conversations and competitive behavior from a pricing perspective?	1975		2	 To give you one example, two weeks ago, I was in a client discussion where they want us to expand what we do within that client portfolio. 22  I think my sense is we had shared over the last year, and I know Nilanjan had also shared that many of the outcomes last year were onetime benefits, for example, on the travel.

936	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 If you look back over the last five or six quarters, and this is something I have heard from many clients who feel that we have consistently supported and delivered without any real constraint. So, we are seeing a benefit as clients say we would rather have you scale up with us. So, the supply situation however we put it, I feel is coming as a benefit to us because as Pravin has shared in other forums, we have an incredible brand, which attracts talent. We have an incredible training capability and all of those things are not short-term things, these you cannot  23  develop over a quarter. That helps us to bring in the talent, which is what clients see. And so yes, there is a supply constraint because there is a huge demand, but we are still seeing good growth and, in fact, improving our growth guidance. Moderator Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.

937	\infosys\june-21.pdf	Sandeep Shah  	 Thanks for the opportunity. The question is, sorry to, again, harp on the margin. Just wanted to understand, is it the guidance factoring in some amount of price increase maybe in the later part of this financial year or the margin guidance is independent of this? Because if I look at wage hikes still have not come into the numbers, attrition is going up, utilization at all-time high, even the offshoring looks at all-time high. So, just wanted to understand the guidance is taking in some pricing increase or it is independent of the same? And second, a bookkeeping question. If I look at the unbilled revenue in this quarter on a Q-on-Q basis has gone up by 12% point, anything to read in the same those free cash flow generation continues to go up?	755		2	 So, just wanted to understand the guidance is taking in some pricing increase or it is independent of the same.

On that basis, we are quite comfortable in the 22% to 24% range as some of these cost headwinds come as well. So, I think that we are quite clear on that. The second question on the unbilled, I think there is some seasonality always which we see in Q1. Usually, that starts tapering out. So, nothing really concerning and you have seen the overall free cash flow. Our DSO has come down as well.

We know some of the initiatives on pricing. Some of them will come through. Some of them would not come through. There will be some new cost pressures. There will be other levers. So, you have to be dynamic and put it in our industry to continue to manage that and you use probabilities of what can work, what do not work. Some levers will over-deliver.

One, on the demand side, we see a good environment and with all the points we discussed and the way we see the market, we have increased our growth guidance from 12% - 14% to 14% - 16% for this year. On the margin, we have a set of levers which we have deployed and are continuing to deploy across the board, whether it is the mix, whether it is the utilization, whether it is a subcontractor usage, whether it is the overall role mix and pyramid, whether it is now more value and pricing on demand for higher demand skills. Plus there are some factors which relate to employee costs and some of the travel coming back. When we mix all of that together, we have confidence that we will be in that margin guidance of 22% - 24%. We will continue to drive the business in that direction keeping in mind our clients, employees and shareholders. We look forward to an exciting and a successful year and thank you again for joining us.	1035		2	 One, on the demand side, we see a good environment and with all the points we discussed and the way we see the market, we have increased our growth guidance from 12% - 14% to 14% - 16% for this year.

We had an excellent start to the financial year with 5.5% sequential growth and 21.4% year- on-year growth in constant currency terms. We continue to gain market share with our Cobalt Cloud capabilities and the differentiated digital value proposition for our clients. Growth continues to be broad-based across business segments, service lines, and geographies. Each of our business segments grew in double- digits with several of them growing at 25% or higher. The US market grew at 18.4% and Europe grew very strongly at 33.2%. Our Digital revenues were 61% of our total revenues in Q1 and they grew at 37.5%. Within Digital our Cloud work continues to grow faster still. Our operating margins were at 20%. Our large deals at $1.69 bn in Q1, which comprise of 19 large deals, 50% of these were net new. Our quarterly attrition declined in Q1. We had a net headcount growth of over 21,000 employees within the company. With our strong growth in Q1 and our current outlook on demand opportunity and pipeline, we  4 increased our revenue growth guidance which was at 13% - 15%, now to 14% - 16% growth for this year. We keep our margin guidance at 21% - 23%. With the increase in cost environment we will be at the lower end of the margin guidance.

At 5.5% for the quarter or 21% for the year, we are significantly ahead – leading the industry in growth, and this is coming primarily from the positioning of our capabilities which are resonating with our clients both on digital and cloud and the overall approach to One Infosys.

960	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  5 On the margin question, as you know, we have given margin guidance at the beginning of the year at 21% - 23% and we have ended this quarter at 20%. Coming from Salil’s answer, I think, we are seeing the growth traction in the market and we are clear that we must put everything behind to get this growth. Whether it is in terms of hiring – we have done a record hiring of 21,000 during the quarter. This is higher than any of the top five other peers in this industry. We also had compensation hike from Q1 itself and that has impacted margins by about 160 basis points. Because of the impact of freshers coming in, the utilization has gone down. But these are all investments because we know in the long run we can actually optimize these costs. We do not want to leave the demand on the table and of course we know there is a massive supply crunch and therefore, in a way these are the flip side of the coin. But we are very clear we will get the demand, we will invest behind getting the supply side sorted out and at the same time work on the cost lever. So, coming to 21% - 23%, we are going to look at the cost much more aggressively, looking at utilization, subcon that we have built up because of this demand – we will look to optimize that over a period. Automation continues to be a big driver for us – every quarter we replace people from various projects into new projects. Looking at the pyramid – the fresher benefit will come into our pyramid. We talked about at the beginning of the year – hiring more than 50,000 freshers. These are all the levers which we have. So we will actually go and get profitable growth. We will invest behind this growth and take out cost inefficiencies as we move along.	1718		0	 This is higher than any of the top five other peers in this industry. 5 On the margin question, as you know, we have given margin guidance at the beginning of the year at 21% - 23% and we have ended this quarter at 20%.

962	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Reema Tendulkar 	 Thank you very much for that. Salil my first question is on deal wins. Deal wins have fallen by 25% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Can that be read as a reflection of slowing demand, the uncertain economic environment which you refer to because deals wins are seen as a proxy for future growth so can you talk about what is happening on the deal front and the deal pipeline? And Nilanjan can we take Q1 margins at 20%, have they bottomed out and what  6 would be the outlook from here on because there will be some further hiccups on account of wage hike and do you think you will be able to hire more than 50,000 freshers given the supply crunch that you are facing?

963	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for the question. On the deal wins we see there are large deals which are always volatile - some quarters high, some quarters low - because these are deals which are typically over $50 mn in size for us and we have had a good number in terms of 19. What we see today is the pipeline for deals, large deals are larger than what we had in the last three and six months so the demand outlook is good. Of course, the environment as we have referenced in our press note is different. There is a talk of recession. There is an increase in the interest rate and there are some pockets where we see this, for example in the mortgage business, in our financial services area, there are pockets where we see some of this impact coming in, but the view for us today given what we see in our pipeline is the overall pipeline is strong at this stage, but of course, we are watching out for what can happen as the environment evolves and changes.	940		2	On the deal wins we see there are large deals which are always volatile - some quarters high, some quarters low - because these are deals which are typically over $50 mn in size for us and we have had a good number in terms of 19.

964	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes, coming back to our margin question. Of course, we are going to be at the bottom end of our 21% to 23% and we are at 20%. We will expect margin expansion from here on, and putting fresher at the pyramid is one way of doing it, and in fact when we put in 85,000 freshers last year that is the thought we had. We will take a hit in utilization but we know over a period of time we can actually improve the utilization as more and freshers go into the system. We cannot suddenly put them in all projects but that is an investment we are doing and absolutely open-minded making into the pyramid itself at the beginning. So that is a source of improvement of our cost structure going forward and like the other levers I have mentioned about in terms of mix, in terms of pricing. We are also looking at how we continue to push the pricing question with our client, whether it is in terms of looking at a discount reduction, whether it is on renewals, whether it is in terms of COLA increases, so that discussion is on. Of course, there is no quick win coming immediately from that, but that is an ongoing discussion which we are having with our clients.  7	1155		2	 We will expect margin expansion from here on, and putting fresher at the pyramid is one way of doing it, and in fact when we put in 85,000 freshers last year that is the thought we had.

Salil you spoke about increasing your guidance range to 14% to 16% but at the same time, your TCV wins have been much lower in this quarter. Is there a reason for that and the second part is that you are talking about recession talks which may impact BFSI going forward. Given these scenarios in place do you think this is a conservative 14% to 16% guidance that you have given? What are the other headwinds that we see going forward? And for Nilanjan 20% margin you hit this quarter but you are saying that you will be maintaining 21% to 23% and remaining at the bottom end of that range. How confident are you to maintain that kind of margin and what is the kind of outlook that you have for hiring this year?	768		2	Salil you spoke about increasing your guidance range to 14% to 16% but at the same time, your TCV wins have been much lower in this quarter.

967	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Sajeet. I think the view we have today is we see that our Q1 was very strong with 5.5% growth sequential - all of this is essentially organic growth. We see good volume in what we are seeing in terms of the pipeline. For us, large deals are always volatile in some quarters up and some quarters down, but the overall pipeline for our large deals remains strong. So at this stage looking at where we see the demand we increased our growth guidance for the full year. Yes, there are pockets as I referenced before where we see of course the impact coming in some areas, but we are not seeing it across the board. Each of our sectors has grown well, many of them 20% to 25%. Geographies have done well. We have had very strong growth in Europe, strong growth in the US, and strong growth in the rest of the world. So we feel, at this stage, that gives us the comfort to increase our growth guidance.	905		2	I think the view we have today is we see that our Q1 was very strong with 5.

We have seen really strong growth this quarter in Europe. Yes, we are looking at other geographies. We have had historically a very good business in Australia which also has today a good pipeline. We continue to expand with strategic partnerships in Japan and in Singapore. So those are markets that we are looking at and those have been some of the markets that have been part of our strategic plan as we have gone through this. Even within Europe, we did an acquisition a few days ago that we announced which was a company focused on Life Sciences in Denmark. So we are looking more and more at Denmark and countries in the Scandinavian Region which are giving us good growth and also good opportunity. So those things will continue across the different geographies we talked about.  9 In terms of localization that is something that has been an ongoing program that we have driven. A lot of it has been driven as you referenced in many of the western geographies - in the US, in Europe is also something that is moving along well in the Australian geography.	1211		2	 So we are looking more and more at Denmark and countries in the Scandinavian Region which are giving us good growth and also good opportunity.

975	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 I think, from an overall supply environment you are all seeing the number in the industry in terms of attrition. Of course, we have seen moderation over the last three quarters. In Q3 it was stabilizing. In Q4 it actually came down by about 5%. This quarter usually is seasonally very high attrition, but despite that we have actually seen a 1% drop. One thing, as we are putting in more freshers, the industry puts in more freshers, we will see that benefit flowing through as well. But the reality today is attrition is higher than what we would like but then we have to go and invest behind the talent. We are paying some stretch salaries in case where we are going outside. We are paying a compensation hike after last June - so in 9 months we  10 have done our next compensation hike - earlier than some of the peers but we are ready to invest. Because this growth is strong as Salil has mentioned - at 5.5% QoQ and 21.4% YoY - it is industry-leading growth. We want to continue to invest there and going forward we will have these cost optimization levers to continuously deploy.	1086		0	I think, from an overall supply environment you are all seeing the number in the industry in terms of attrition.

Could you give me some colour on what will be driving the improved pipeline are there particular verticals or business units that are showing greater resilience? And Mr. Roy the second question is on pricing. You said you are having these conversations with clients in the past when the rupee has depreciated significantly clients have asked for some of those gains to be paid back to them. How is the rupee depreciation factoring into the pricing conversation you may be having?	681		2	 Parekh first on demand, you said that the pipeline is better than it has been in the past three and six months.

978	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Hi Jochelle, thanks for your questions. On the pipeline what we see are really two types of big programs in the large deal pipeline. One is when clients have embarked or are embarking on the digital or cloud transformation journey. So there for example there are clients which are working on their supply chains, there are clients that are working on customer connect, there are clients that are working on optimizing their financial processes and these are very strong programs that clients have launched. These give them tremendous impact in their end market or efficiency in their business so these are critical programs. Then there are cloud transformation programs where clients are seeing benefits from leveraging our Cobalt capabilities on a private Cloud set up. They are seeing some benefit with a public Cloud transformation across their whole infrastructure and these need a lot of work and they are driving some of the large deals. And then there is a set of deals which are focused on costs  11 and making sure that the efficiencies that the clients are looking for are coming through. So we have strength in automation, we have strength in what we call applied AI/Artificial Intelligence. These are things that we use to make sure that we can optimize the technology landscape for our clients and that gives them a cost-benefit. So both of those are things that we are seeing in the pipeline and given the environment there are drives for growth and there are drives for costs which are giving us the benefit. There are nuances across the different segments. We still see some strengths which are visible, for example in our CMT segment, we see strengths in our manufacturing segment, financial services segment, overall is solid with some pockets that I mentioned earlier for example in mortgage where we see some areas of weakness. So the overall picture that we see are both sorts of deals are in the pipeline on the growth side and the cost side.	1965		2	 So both of those are things that we are seeing in the pipeline and given the environment there are drives for growth and there are drives for costs which are giving us the benefit.

979	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 On your question on the rupee depreciation, I think in a normal period, you would be having these conversations like you said, but these are highly abnormal times. We have seen wage inflation across the world. The consequent impact on attrition as well and clients are very well aware of that because they are seeing that in their own domains and their own set of people. So in that sense we are seeing much less when people asking for discounts etc. They are aware of that impact, so we are pushing back as much on that and we have seen a much lesser impact on that. And in fact, more conversation on how we start getting COLA increases against accounts when the accounts come in for renewals, can we get a price hike on our digital rate cards etc. So those are kind of conservations are happening. We have not heard anything more about the rupee and the dollar really.	871		2	 We have seen wage inflation across the world.

982	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 I think we mentioned that we are ready to invest behind this growth because we know we have the optimization levers. For instance, our subcon which used to trend a year and a half, two years back at 6.5%, are closer to 11.3% now - that is a lever. We know we will get our freshers and we will get our lateral recruitments in, attrition will come down and we will be able to replace this. But at this moment in a way we are on a treadmill and therefore this whole subcon increase is easily one lever which we have available. Utilization - deliberately we brought it down because we want freshers to be hired, we want them to go through training in Mysore for four months, then we put them on the bench and over a period of time they start getting deployed and these are therefore investments because you just cannot get freshers and overnight start changing the overall pyramid. That is an investment we are ready to make really. Coming back to your fixed price issue, absolutely - so when we model our contracts over a longer period of time we build in wage inflation, we build on what are the automations we can do there, the onsite-offshore mix that is the lever, the extra work which we can also get from many of these clients - because once you are sitting front and center in a large deal we pretty much have a ring side view of what is happening inside the clients, and many of our add on deals which we get from the clients because of we have done the large deals are at significantly higher margin. So, there are lots of other tools which we have to see the overall margin profile - both on the deal and around the deal as well.	1637		2	 Utilization - deliberately we brought it down because we want freshers to be hired, we want them to go through training in Mysore for four months, then we put them on the bench and over a period of time they start getting deployed and these are therefore investments because you just cannot get freshers and overnight start changing the overall pyramid.

And Nilanjan, I did not get the thing on hiring guidance so are you sticking to 50,000 or are you increasing it on the back of your higher revenue guidance for this year since you have already added 21,000 in this quarter?	817		1	Salil just wanted to know the kind of project that you are seeing that has given you the confidence to kind of increase the revenue guidance annually because there are lot of analysts believe that in the current market clients will look at cost-saving projects, it will not be discretionary, transformational spend that is happening so anything different that you are seeing that kind of giving you the confidence.

985	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for the question, Chandra. I think in terms of the demand and the type of projects or programs on large deals there are two types where there is one which is driven more towards the growth areas on digital and on cloud and there is a lot of work on Cloud transformation that is in our pipeline. And then there is another as you pointed which is focused more on cost and efficiency and there we are driving from what we have in terms of our leading automation capabilities, what we are doing in Artificial Intelligence to help optimize the client technology landscape. So we have both of those within our mix and as we looked at even in the previous months, we have made sure that our focus remains on both types of programs and frankly we feel in terms of automation, we have a tremendous capability that we think will be of great use to clients in any environment as we look at making efficiencies within the tech landscape. On attrition, what we have stated, our quarterly attrition has come down and we have seen moderation last quarter we have seen moderation this quarter. As we look out for some of the benefits of the initiatives we put in place that are coming through, that is the approach with respect to attrition.	1233		1	 As we look out for some of the benefits of the initiatives we put in place that are coming through, that is the approach with respect to attrition.

986	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Your question on freshers so as we plan the talent model for the year it is a combination of freshers, it is a combination of attrition, it is a combination of lateral hiring and of course subcons. So when we put all this together, at the moment we are seeing about 50,000 it may go up, and the beauty I think of COVID is for the industry is, now we have been able to get freshers on demand because earlier the entire industry actually used to lock themselves up  14 with the fresher entirely in the campus which we do in the January cycle. Now we have a combination of this lock in during the January campus hiring cycle and throughout the year we have a program which is off campus running. So that is a big benefit we had over the last two years to get a much more flexi-oriented talent model for freshers.	810		1	Your question on freshers so as we plan the talent model for the year it is a combination of freshers, it is a combination of attrition, it is a combination of lateral hiring and of course subcons.

989	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Sankalp I think the second question you broke off. On the first, the question was a macro question, if I got it right? Here, I think the way we look at this as I shared earlier, there are pockets where we see some changes. For example, I gave the example of mortgages in Financial Services. There are areas like that but the prevalent view across our pipeline today is we have a good pipeline overall. Now looking ahead, we do not have a view on what is likely to happen let us say 12 months out or 18 months out. Our focus remains really on what we are seeing in our pipeline today and making sure as we have finished one quarter of this financial year that we work our way through this financial year always being aware of the environment, what is going on, well at the same time when clients are looking for changes, whether their growth driven initiatives on Digital or Cloud or cost driven initiatives focused on automation or other areas that we provide them with the capabilities and the services that can help them. So yes we are aware and obviously cognizant of what the macro environment  15 is, but that is not what is driving everything in terms of our day-to-day. We see the pipeline, we see what our clients are looking for and we are making sure we are agile as things evolve that we can also adapt. The second part we missed out. There was something about hiring. We did not get the full question.	1422		1	Thanks, Sankalp I think the second question you broke off.

994	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Let me start off. Thanks for your questions, Sai. On the attrition, in the previous quarters, we have shared some of the focus that the team and we have put on what we really want to do in improving the engagement with employees. There are areas which are focused on increased opportunities, there are areas which are focused on increased rewards, there are areas which are focused on making sure that there is more stability and predictability in the way career progression is managed for our employees, and there are areas where we are making sure that all of the training capabilities and facilities are available to develop individuals all through their careers. We have seen much more engagement from employees, there is tremendous flexibility that we have vis-à-vis how we have employees working in the hybrid model. All of these are initiatives that have been launched over the past several quarters and over some years, which we see starting to give us benefit, and that is where we have seen on a quarterly basis reduction in the attrition in the first quarter.	1071		2	 There are areas which are focused on increased opportunities, there are areas which are focused on increased rewards, there are areas which are focused on making sure that there is more stability and predictability in the way career progression is managed for our employees, and there are areas where we are making sure that all of the training capabilities and facilities are available to develop individuals all through their careers.

995	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Your first question basically was on the profit decline and that is directly linked to the operating margin. We have talked about the decline in operating margin and the reasons. The wage hike was the biggest, it was 1.6%. This was both onsite and offshore and these have been higher than what we have done in the past. Our compensation hikes in the western economies was even higher what we have done normally. Even in India it was high single- digit with top performers getting double digit and like I said, this is an investment we are willing to make. So that is the fundamental decline in margin and that flows straight into net profit decline. The second question was dollar rupee - of course, there will be some benefits  17 going forward but like you have seen in this quarter, there is also cross currency headwinds because the depreciation of the Euro, the GBP, the Aussie dollar and the Canadian dollar. So in fact, half of our rupee dollar benefit, this quarter was eroded by the cross currency headwinds so we actually only got a 30 BPS benefit on our margins because of currency. So, we should see some benefits of that but just to make sure that we are modeling in the cross- currency as well.	1209		0	 Our compensation hikes in the western economies was even higher what we have done normally.

With guidance of 14% to 16%, can you break the growth that you have seen in terms of deal nature and pricing scenario, attrition continues to go up, will the hiring  20 target be the same i.e., 50,000? The second is it looks like you and your peers have missed on margin performance which kind of means that the supply issue is still out of control. How is Infosys seeing the attrition going ahead?

1020	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Sandeep. Good morning and good evening to everyone on the call. Thank you all for taking the time to join us. We had an excellent start to the financial year with 5.5% sequential growth and 21.4% year- on-year growth in constant currency terms.  4  We continue to gain market share with our Cobalt cloud capabilities and our differentiated digital value proposition driving a significant pipeline of opportunities for us. For example a premier online retailer in the U.S. leveraged Infosys Cobalt to embark on a cloud-driven transformation journey to enhance the customer experience and improve their security posture. Another example is European manufacturer who is reimagining their Digital workplace with best-of-breed network security and IT infrastructure powered by Infosys Cobalt. There are examples like this all across the spectrum in different sectors and that are driving Infosys Cobalt into the market. Clients continue to place an immense amount of trust and confidence in Infosys to help accelerate their digital transformation agenda, both on efficiency and the growth dimension of their business. The strong growth we have seen in the quarter lays a robust foundation for the year. Growth continues to remain broad-based across the segments, service lines and geographies. Each of our business segments grew in double-digits with several of them growing at 25% or higher. In terms of geography the U.S. geography grew at 18.4% and Europe grew at 33.2%. This indicates a healthy demand environment and is a reflection of how our industry-leading digital capabilities are relevant for our clients. Our Digital revenues were 61% of the total and grew at 37.5% in the quarter in constant currency terms. Within digital, our cloud work continues to grow faster, with our Cobalt cloud capability seeing significant traction with our clients. Our overall pipeline remains strong. We do see pockets of weakness, for example in the area of mortgages in Financial Services. We keep a close watch on the evolving macro environment in terms of the changes to the pipeline. Within our pipeline, we also have focus in addition to the growth areas in digital and cloud to the cost areas through automation and AI.  5  Our operating margins were at 20%. We have completed the majority of our compensation review for this year. Nilanjan, will also provide more details on the overall margin update. Some other highlights of our results are - We signed 19 large deals with a TCV of $1.69 bn. This is comprises of 50% net new work - Our onsite mix was at 24.3% - As we build capacity for the future, our utilization was at healthy levels of 84.7% - Our free cash flow was strong at $656 mn - Our quarterly attrition declined. Historically, Q1 attrition increases by three to four percentage points sequentially on a quarterly annualized basis; however, our attrition declined by one percentage point on a sequential basis - reflecting the impact of various initiatives we have put in place - We had a net headcount increase of over 21,000 employees attracting leading talent from the market, which is a reflection of our enhanced recruitment capabilities, solid brand and deeper penetration into various talent markets. Our Cobalt Cloud capability continues to be market leading. We have 360 technology and domain solutions, five of our assets have over 50 clients each, we have 150 industry focused solutions, 20 Infosys living labs, 50 experimentation programs, and 60,000 knowledge assets. Our ‘One Infosys’ approach is serving us well to bring the best of Infosys and service to our client’s needs. Earlier this month we announced the acquisition of BASE Life Sciences, a Denmark-based technology and consulting firm in the life sciences industry. BASE brings to Infosys domain expertise in medical, digital marketing, clinical and regulatory areas. With our strong growth in Q1 and our current outlook on demand opportunity and pipeline, we increase our revenue growth guidance which was at 13% to 15%, now to 14% to 16% for the full year. We keep our margin guidance at 21% to 23%. With the increased cost environment, we will be at the lower end of this margin guidance. Thank you and with that let me hand it over to Nilanjan for his update.  6 	4259		2	 Our Cobalt Cloud capability continues to be market leading.

1021	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Thanks Salil. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining this call in an early Monday morning. We had a strong start of FY2023 with a robust year-on-year growth of 21.4% in constant currency. All our business segments and major geos recorded double-digit growth with manufacturing, communication and EURS along with Europe region recording 25% plus growth. Sequentially, revenue growth was 5.5% which was led by a healthy volume growth and some RPP benefits. Digital revenues now constitute 61% of total and grew by 37.5% in constant currency. Client metrics were strong with increase in client counts across revenue buckets compared to the previous year. Number of $50 mn clients increased by 10 to 69 creating the next potential centurions. Number of $100 mn clients increased by 4 to 38 and the number of $200 mn clients have grown by 6 in the last one year. This reflects our ability to deepen mining across our large clients. We had another quarter of strong employee additions with over 21,000 to cater to the growth opportunities ahead. The fresher addition was particularly strong which resulted in drop in utilization to 84.7%. Onsite effort mix inched up to 24.3%. Voluntary LTM attrition increased marginally to 28.4%. Quarterly annualized attrition declined another by 1% from Q4 levels despite Q1 usually seeing an uptick due to seasonality. As announced earlier we have given competitive salary increases for majority of employees from April. Given the supply tightness and high prevailing inflation, salary increases across all geos this year are higher than historical levels. The increases vary based on job levels and performance of employees with top performers getting double-digit hikes. Salary hike for other employees is being done effective 1st July. Q1 margin stood at 20%, a drop of 150 basis points versus previous quarter. The major components of the sequential margin movements were as below:  7  Headwinds of - 1.6% due to salary increases, - 0.4% due to drop in utilization as we create capacity for future, - 0.3% due to increases in subcon, third party and other costs. These were offset by tailwinds of - 0.5% due to increase in RPP from higher working days, a reversal of a client's contractual provision in our FS segment partially offset by discounts. - 0.3% benefits from rupee depreciation benefits partially offset by cross-currency headwinds. Q1 EPS grew by 4.4% in rupee terms on a year-on-year basis. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and debt-free. Consolidated cash and investments were 4.4 bn at the end of the quarter after returning more than $850 mn to the shareholders through dividends. This has led to increase in ROE to 31%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $656 mn which is a conversion of 95% of net profits. Yield on cash balance remained stable at 5.3% in Q1. DSO declined by 4 days sequentially to 63. DSO including net unbilled was 82 days an increase of 1 day versus Q4. Coming to segmental performance: We signed 19 large deals in Q1 with a TCV of $1.69 bn. This comprises of the 50% net new. We have signed 5 large deals in retail and CPG, 4 in Hi-Tech, 3 each in financial services and energy utility resources and services and 2 each in manufacturing and communications verticals. Region-wise 15 were in Americas and 2 each in Europe and RoW. In Financial Services clients continue to focus on digital customer experience, contact center transformation and virtual branches aimed at improving customer engagement. While the order pipeline remains strong across regions, we are seeing some slowness in mortgage industry and lending business due to increased interest rates. We remain watchful of impacts of emerging global developments on budget for clients.  8  In the retail segment the pace of Digital transformation large-scale cost breakouts and improving business resilience continues to be on the rise across various subsegments. Our focus on proactive engagement has helped us in creating a robust pipeline. Clients are monitoring the emerging macro situation and the impact of that on their business. In communications segment clients are focused on rapid digitization and protecting their assets from cyber threats, we see enormous potential to partner with them both on the digital transformation agenda as well as in the cost takeout front. Deal pipeline in energies, utilities, resources and services segments comprises of opportunities around cost takeouts, vendor consolidation, digital transformation, cloud-led transformation and asset monetization across industry sub-verticals. Manufacturing segment is seeing broad-based growth across geographies and industry sub- verticals. The sector has seen traction across energy, IoT, supply chain, cloud ERP and accelerated cloud adoption. In Q1 we have been ranked as leader in 9 ratings in the areas of Oracle Cloud, SAP S/4HANA, Public Cloud, Industry 4.0, employee experience and automation services. In this supply constrained environment, we continue to invest in our growth momentum which requires us to hire premium, skill talent while simultaneously investing in existing employees through competitive compensation increases across geos. Additionally, we expect normalization of costs like travel and other overheads. We will continue to focus on various cost optimization measures including rationalization of subcons, flattening of the pyramid, increasing automation, reducing onsite mix and increasing pricing. Whilst we retain our operating margin guidance of 21% to 23%, we expect to be at the bottom end of the range. The revenue guidance for the year has been revised to 14% to 16% from 13% to 15% earlier. With that we can open the call for questions. Moderator  9  Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question is from the line of Surendra Goyal from Citi Group. Please go ahead. Surendra Goyal Thanks for that. Good morning just a couple of questions from my side. Firstly a clarification. Nilanjan, I believe you said that the contractual provision was largely offset by discounts. Could you please clarify a bit. Did you mean discounts to the same client or discounts in general? Curious because on one hand we are talking of a strong demand environment and potential price hikes and at the same time we are also talking of discounts?	6360		2	 Additionally, we expect normalization of costs like travel and other overheads.

1022	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 The comment was 0.5% increase in RPP is a combination of three to four elements – higher working days, the client contraction provision reversal benefits partially offset by discount. So it is not a direct linkage of discounts and client contractual provisions. It is not to the same client. These are generic discounts and these automatically keep on coming. But, like I said discounts have come down as we have started negotiating with our clients in terms of pricing but that is the net impact of all these. Surendra Goyal Just another question on margin down 360 bps year-over-year, operating profit growth Y-o-Y is worse in historical trends despite all the strong demand and growth we are talking about. So if you just think about this 360 basis point decline, how much of that is really investment which you think can be recouped as we go forward from here?	865		0	The comment was 0. 5% increase in RPP is a combination of three to four elements – higher working days, the client contraction provision reversal benefits partially offset by discount.

1023	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 When we were 360 bps down, we knew we were having some benefits in a way - our utilization was very high it was 88%, we have never operated at that level before, the benefits of travel etc. Now we are seeing more and more of that has been coming back. So that is something which we were well aware of in last year. But as we see the demand volume ahead, I think we are very clear that in terms of our ability to support this demand first we  10  have to hire, we have to pay competitively. So we actually did two wage hikes in calendar year 2021 and now this year we have already rolled out in April. So within one and a half year we have done three substantial CRs and actually in September last year also we did a skill based increase. So we have been continuously investing behind that and we know that to capitalize this demand we have to pay for premium skills. We have to go behind the volume. Comparing subcontractor costs - perhaps from an industry leading 6.5% position we are closer to 11% now, but again these are something we know over a period of time we have a lot of optimization levers. We do not want to leave a five-year demand on the table because of short-term cost pressures and these we can optimize over this year and over the future as well. So in that sense we are quite confident and that is why we have talked about 21% to 23% range and we will be at the bottom end of the range. Of course if we are 20% today, we will see that improvement as the year progresses. Surendra Goyal Sure thanks for that I will get back in the queue. Moderator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Moshe Katri Thanks. Spectacular numbers especially on revenues side of the business. Just a follow-up to the last topic or question about margins. We are getting a lot of pushbacks on that. From your perspective looking at the levers that you highlighted, what do you think is the biggest potential lever here for you to be able to catch up to the margin range that you mentioned and then I have a follow-up after that.	2090		2	 Now we are seeing more and more of that has been coming back.

1024	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Firstly if you see, how our margin profile, has changed, so one, of course has been this utilization and in fact, 21,000+ net adds during the quarter which is well above our volumes and that is to create the buffer. So when we put in freshers, we train them and then over a  11  period of time, we are able to put them into production. So you cannot just have higher freshers and expect them to start contributing from day 1. We are very vigilant about that. They go through mandatory training in Myosre, and then we put them into projects. So that is one big part of where we think we can start improving. As the hiring catches up automatically, you will see the stabilization of subcon costs, which as percentage of revenue, you are seeing this increase every quarter. While we have seen it flattening out and over the future, as we got our recruitments done and we are able to hire fresher, we should see benefits coming out of that. Pyramid benefits will continue to happen for us. While we are seeing some adverse impact from the onsite movement, this is largely as travel overseas starts, but we think this is more of a aberration in terms of uptick, because the inherent story of taking cost out and having a more offshore mix in the entire cost optimization will come into benefits especially in this environment where cost take out is becoming a big theme across our clients. So, we know we can have multiple areas. Pricing is another thing, which we have been talking about. We have seen less impact of discounts, etc., we are going back to clients in terms of COLA adjustments at the time of renewals. Now these are much more longer-term impact decisions, but I think at least the conversations have started in right direction across all the segments and you can hear similar commentary across. So I think these are the areas we continue to focus on and are something we have done over the years. We continue to be very forceful in terms of our cost efficiency exercises. Moshe Katri Just as a follow-up, just remind us what is the sensitivity for margins versus utilization rates i.e., 100 basis points expansion in utilization rates what does it mean to margins in terms of sensitivity? Thank you.	2211		2	 So I think these are the areas we continue to focus on and are something we have done over the years.

1025	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes, so I think it depends on by which levels we see utilization. So, it is quite complicated if you have a different utilization in onsite, different in offshore and then the impact of the freshers in the pyramid in that utilization. So, it is a bit complicated how the mix changes. I  12  just cannot give you off the cuff number of what 1% will lead to, but to give you the impact in this quarter, 40 basis points because of utilization on margins.

At the end of the fourth quarter, and not just Infosys but across the industry what the management commentary had indicated compared to that the margin performance appears to be a sharper decline. Now Salil what do you think could be the reason behind that? Is it driven by higher than expected demand and higher use of subcontracting than what you are planning early or is it more supply side driven that the fresher was higher than what we had planned for through the quarter?	582		0	 Is it driven by higher than expected demand and higher use of subcontracting than what you are planning early or is it more supply side driven that the fresher was higher than what we had planned for through the quarter.

1029	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes, so we do not operate in a vacuum and this industry also does not operate in a vacuum. The attrition trends are pretty much similar across industries but the good news, like you said is that attrition is coming down. Our quarter attrition figure is actually below our LTM  13  figures and as Salil said we are 1% down on a sequential basis, we were 5% down in the previous quarter and we were flat the earlier quarter. The reported LTM is more of a catch-up effect and in that sense you will see stabilization. The freshers will start coming in and getting permeated. So that benefit in a way should start creeping into the cost structure because at the end of the day if you are putting freshers we have less attrition, the fresh hikes which you have to give for lateral hirers should come down, joining bonuses impact should come down. So these are the things which can play in our favour. You have seen these numbers of decline pretty much across industries.  I think we have a very, very sharp cost optimization program in a way which will go and offset these headwinds.	1079		0	 The attrition trends are pretty much similar across industries but the good news, like you said is that attrition is coming down.

When we launched our strategy a few weeks ago just at the start of the quarter we had shared also a new focus or an expanded focus on Europe. Denmark for us is a very strategic market, the whole Scandinavian market is a very strategic market for us. So that is the second area that it benefits us. We also see clients are using the capabilities of BASE as a starting point and then that leads to large technology transformation, digital transformation  14  and that helps us overall in terms of scaling up that segment. That is a segment which we feel is a strong segment for the future and where in our view underweight in percentage terms.

And what are the tensions on that to your margin model? So you mentioned that attrition has in fact moved lower, do you think attrition continues to move lower and how do you think wage inflation will unfold over the next about three, four quarters and be a force in the gross margin equation and then will follow up? 	457		1	 And what are the tensions on that to your margin model.

1036	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 I think like we started last year we were very clear that we have to be competitive in the market. So, we did the first hike in January of 2021 then we did the next hike in July of 2021 then we did a follow-up on our talent in September of 2021. In a way, we have not waited one year we have actually gone ahead and done our majority of our wage hike from 1st of April this year. Increase for middle to higher level to senior force will happen in July but not the same margin impact of quarter one which was very broad based. Other than that, I think these are quite competitive and of course if you see in the mix, we also get a lot of laterals where there is a hidden cost of hiring because they come at stretches. So in a way, your overall weighted average compensation in any case is going up across. I think overall this is a very competitive hike. In India it is more like high single digits and in  15  overseas geos because of high wage inflation across we have given very competitive hikes. This is something which we have not done before. So these are very much higher than what we did in the past. But we think this is something which is going to stand up in good stead in terms of attrition and we have seen three quarters of the attrition benefits and expect it to continue.	1288		2	 I think overall this is a very competitive hike.

1038	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for that. A couple of points that you raised, I think what we see on the demand, the pipeline that we have today for our large deals is larger than what we had three or six months ago. Having said that, we of course recognize what is going on in the global environment and we mentioned a couple of areas. Nilanjan talked within retail, he also mentioned within Financial Services - mortgages. So we see pockets where we see some impact. On the overall deal discussions we see a little bit where it is slowing in the decision making; however, the pipeline remains strong for us today. We have also get two types of deals, one is deals which are on digital transformation or cloud which are growth orientated for clients driving to what they want to do with their customers in their supply chain, how they want to make an impact. The second is on cost, we have a very strong play on cost and efficiency through our automation work, through our artificial intelligence work where we can really impact the cost base in the tech landscape of our clients. So those are areas which we are already very active within this environment and given our positioning we feel good that those will start to come into play as and when the environment changes. But today this is how we are seeing the demand situation.  16  Now your other question was will that have a change on the wage if the macro evolving. We do not have a clear view on where that will go because it is a function of how the macro evolves and what happens. Of course, we are seeing attrition starting to come off a little bit and that will clearly have a positive impact for us with respect to compensation. So the timeline is not clear, it depends on how the macro evolves.	1735		2	A couple of points that you raised, I think what we see on the demand, the pipeline that we have today for our large deals is larger than what we had three or six months ago.

The second is in terms of salary increases is it only for the associate level this quarter and if so then the question is that we have 145,000 associates JL3 and below and 130,000 people in the mid level and general understanding is mid level obviously as a percentage of the employee cost it should be higher so the thought process was about should not your margin impact be even higher next quarter - if you could just help with that thought process that will be very helpful?

1050	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Sudheer Guntupalli 	 Good morning gentlemen. Thanks for giving me this opportunity. I have just one question on margins. Ideally the strong growth at the headline level should have translated into some operating leverage, but that does not seem to be happening and Nilanjan we seem to be of the view, we will chase growth for now and focus on margin optimization at a later date. What is the risk to that hypothesis because this growth margin paradox seem to be a mere reflection of what is happening in U.S. and U.K. now a very tight job market, very high nominal growth, but very little benefit trickling down to the bottomline level. So sooner or later this  19  nominal growth rates may cool off and onsite job markets and some supply costs may auto recalibrate. But back in India job market may not be as much of a free market as it is in U.K. and U.S. there may be some sticky elements both at headcount and wage level translating into negative operating leverage as demand moderates. So what is the risk that margins will remain structurally lower than even the pre-COVID levels going ahead because demand tends to be more cyclical while some of these supply costs tend to be more sticky?	1175		0	 there may be some sticky elements both at headcount and wage level translating into negative operating leverage as demand moderates.

1051	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 There are a couple of things. See one is that many of these cost increases cannot be passed on the client on day one. If I have to give a wage hike on all my existing base they will come up for renewals that is the time when you have a wage discussion. When you are doing new deal, automatically we will build it and the industry in a way will build it into their wage profile. So these things will automatically flow back, there is no free lunch for anybody. So that is one thing which will happen over a period of time, but that is more of a generic point I am making. But in terms of subcons, we have operated at 6%-6.5% of subcon; today we are sitting at 11.3%, there is no reason for us to be at these levels unless we know what the job market is. In the overall demand environment, when our recruiting picks up we can replace these subcons with our own headcount, put more freshers into projects and this is something we have been doing very well in the past as well. So I think these levers are well known for us, we know how utilization works, our pyramid works, so we are quite confident in the forward model of taking out cost from our overall structure.	1165		1	 But in terms of subcons, we have operated at 6%-6.

Our next question is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ankur Rudra Thank you for taking my question. First question is what is the level of conservatism or realism infused into both the revenue and the margin guide this time, part of that is on the revenue guide we have given the potential macro headwinds ahead of us and the ask rate from the second half of this year. Similarly, on margins we still have another round of wage hikes which can impact margins by maybe as much as 100 basis points if I look at the wage hike impact so far and a similar ratio between the first and the second rounds in the previous years and also keeping up travel and facility costs? Thank you.	802		1	 First question is what is the level of conservatism or realism infused into both the revenue and the margin guide this time, part of that is on the revenue guide we have given the potential macro headwinds ahead of us and the ask rate from the second half of this year.

1055	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for the question. This is Salil. Let me start off and then Nilanjan may have a few points to add. On the guidance for growth, as we have shared in the past, the approach we take is we see how things are as we look at the financial year today. What we saw is in Q1 we had extremely strong revenue growth - 5.5% and we also had underlying volume growth which was very strong. When we see the outlook, where we have clarity looking ahead for some period of time and then a set of estimates that we have for the rest of the financial year and also looking at how typically H2 works versus H1 and then putting in some views on where the end of the year could be. Based on that, we felt comfortable to increase the revenue growth guidance, whether it is conservative or realistic that is the approach we take to make sure that we then share what we think the revenue is going to look like from here.  21  On the margin I will start off and then Nilanjan will talk a little bit about the wage component and what we have done. Overall on the margin, we have made sure that we work to get all of the levers in place. So the approach to driving cost efficiency is in place, several levers that Nilanjan mentioned, one of the bigger ones we got the bulk impact, the vast majority of our compensation increase already done in Q1. So yes there is a small component but it is not really a huge component that will come up and then we see steadily other areas which will help us. There are areas where we can focus on how the subcontracting works, there are areas where we can focus on discussions with clients vis-à-vis wage increases and COLA, areas where we are doing work which is having significant impact for clients. So we think there are a set of those levers that can help us through the margin discussion that will be focused on in this financial year. Our approach is to make sure that we remain a high margin business and that is the underlying thing that we are working with.

So yes there is a small component but it is not really a huge component that will come up and then we see steadily other areas which will help us.  On the guidance for growth, as we have shared in the past, the approach we take is we see how things are as we look at the financial year today.  When we see the outlook, where we have clarity looking ahead for some period of time and then a set of estimates that we have for the rest of the financial year and also looking at how typically H2 works versus H1 and then putting in some views on where the end of the year could be. Let me start off and then Nilanjan may have a few points to add.  So the approach to driving cost efficiency is in place, several levers that Nilanjan mentioned, one of the bigger ones we got the bulk impact, the vast majority of our compensation increase already done in Q1.	estimates behind increase missing tomorrow there add clearer grow changed done clear invest guidance here remarks added nothing statement mixed good benefit saying said comments right correct forecasts yes rise bullish intact progress contribute forecast adding comment upside unclear positive over	estimates behind acquisitions increase neutral underperformed conservative there add fall concerned grow changed done strong clear here guidance invest remarks important help sure money improving statement continue mixed good benefit saying said comments different right correct forecasts working yes bullish rise intact progress strengthening announcement forecast that contribute report start comment not changes upside outperformed unclear positive over

Just wanted your thoughts on how broad based in North America you will see such problems to sustain for a long time until you call out some headwinds in BFSI, even that still have quite a bit of revenue. If you could give some color about how sustained the demand environment is there. And secondly on the pyramids, we have already seen a large intake of freshers last year so had hoped that some of that would have come into production and helped us offset the margin headwinds through this quarter but looks like given the utilization, as well it does not look like much of that has happened.

1062	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes we have hired a lot of freshers last year and many of them also have gone into training pipeline because as we had the previous year there was nothing really in the pipeline in terms of hiring. So in fact if you see our utilization there is a 2% gap between the excluding trainees and including trainee numbers on a year-on-year basis as well. We continue to deploy them into projects. Like I said, you cannot overnight stuff projects with freshers and that is why it is important to build a pipeline in advance and make them go through the trainings and then put them into production bench and then move them into projects as well. So that benefit will come in and we are seeing that slowly coming in, but it is important to invest ahead. If you are planning just in time, you will be probably sub optimizing in terms of how fast you can deploy. So that is why we have made these investments because we know it will take time for these freshers to be productive, hence it is important to make that investment ahead.	1021		2	 So that is why we have made these investments because we know it will take time for these freshers to be productive, hence it is important to make that investment ahead.

1069	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Firstly, you have seen the revenue growth which has been quite spectacular in this segment. This has been led by large deals. As we talk about our approach, from day one a lot of clients would like to see savings, but we are very clear that over a period of time we have a lot of cost optimization levers. On day one you cannot pivot the cost structure, whereas clients may ask for the savings, but we know there are enough levers over time that we continue to deploy  25  on all these large deals. And if I go back to the last three years, four years in fact when the large deal strategy started, we have actually seen an increase in margins over that period. So, there is no historical correlation in saying whether the large deals are dilutive, because we continue working on taking out costs from the system and that gets factored into our entire process. We look at how we are going to optimize onsite offshore, many of these projects require dramatic automation, we can inject that through all our services which we are providing, we know how the pyramid works. So these are the things which we know works over the lifetime of these large deals and that is something we know we can deploy. So that is something, without getting specifically into manufacturing, what we do well.	1284		2	 And if I go back to the last three years, four years in fact when the large deal strategy started, we have actually seen an increase in margins over that period.

Sometimes we have to push harder on some pedals in terms of accelerating some programs. And then going back to the level where we are today at 20% and we are saying we will be at the bottom end of 21%, I think that should give you a good sense of the margin trajectory for the rest of the year.	597		2	I think when we do our margins forecast with a combination of factors that we look at and that equation keeps on changing and it is more dynamic.

1089	\infosys\june-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 From the mega deals, I think again we do not share anything specific in terms of what we publish. The color from our side is we have mega deals in our pipeline, if that will give you a context. On the pricing, we have seen pricing currently holding in our deal values for Q1. My sense is we have seen examples that Nilanjan was sharing earlier where we are working, we have worked with clients to demonstrate to them the impact of compensation increases and that has translated to COLA or price benefits. We have had examples where we have had increases, which are related to the digital high value work that we are driving for clients. We now have to make sure we take that across a whole portfolio and see the benefits coming into our business. Typically the salary increase happens at a periodic time and these things where we  30  have not seen a high inflation environment like this for over 40 years in the western markets that takes a longer time. That is what as Nilanjan shared is part of what we have put in place to support our margin as we go ahead.	1062		1	 On the pricing, we have seen pricing currently holding in our deal values for Q1.

I thank all the members,  - 5 -  colleagues on the Board, auditors and the management team for joining this meeting over video conference.  Chairman’s speech – Nandan Nilekani  Dear shareholders, welcome to the 42nd Annual General Meeting of Infosys. As we gather again virtually to discuss the progress made in the year gone past, it is a pleasure to host you. On behalf of the Infosys Board of Directors, I thank you for making the time to join us today and for your continued support over the years.  Fiscal 2023 has been a year of strong overall growth – 15.4% in constant currency, delivering US$ 18.2 billion in revenues. Operating margin for the year remained healthy at 21%. And we generated US$ 2.5 billion in free cash flows. Our digital business continued to expand and makes up 62.2% of our total revenue. We grew in double digits across most industry segments and across major geographic markets, 26% in Europe and 12% in the US. We had 95 large deals valued at US$ 9.8 billion for the year, of which 40% was net new. This promises a solid foundation to grow and build resilience in the months to come.  For fiscal 2023, the Board has recommended a final dividend of ₹17.50 per share. Together with the interim dividend of ₹16.50 per share already paid, the total dividend per share for FY23 amounts to ₹34, which is a 9.7% increase over FY22. With this, the Company has announced a total dividend of approximately ₹14,200 crores for FY23.  A Company has completed the open market share buyback on February 13, at an average price of approximately ₹1,539 per share compared to the maximum buyback price of ₹1,850 per share. Including the recently concluded buyback and final dividend for FY23, the Company has returned approximately 86% of free cash flow to shareholders over four years starting FY20.  The shareholders at the 41st AGM held on June 25th, 2022, reappointed Salil Parekh as CEO and MD effective July 1st, 2022, till March 31st, 2027. Salil is effectively steering Infosys towards growth and continued relevance through the changing economic macro environment. He has successfully institutionalized the ‘One Infosys’ approach to position our company to work with clients, both for their long-ranging digital transformation and for cost efficiency and resilience programs that are of vital importance to them to thrive in the near term.  The shareholders also approved the appointment of Govind Iyer as an independent director, effective Jan 12, 2023, for a term of five years till Jan 11, 2028. The Board, based on the recommendations of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, appointed D. Sundaram as Lead Independent Director of the Company, effective March 23rd, 2023, and recommends the appointment of Helene Auriol Potier as an Independent Director of the Company effective May 26th, 2023, for a period of three years, subject to the approval of the shareholders. Kiran Mazumdar-Shah, Lead Independent Director, retired as a member of the Board of Directors on completion of tenure effective March 22nd, 2023. We profusely thank Kiran for having been an integral member of the Infosys family, providing valuable guidance and leadership to the Board over the years. I am personally very grateful to her as she has been a tremendous ally, and an amazing colleague on the Board ever since I rejoined Infosys in August  - 6 -  2017. Uri Levine also retired as an independent director effective April 19th, 2023, upon completion of his term. The Bboard places on record its sincere appreciation over Uri’s contribution to Infosys.  The receding pandemic brought an end to one set of challenges, but its aftermath has created new ones. The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all morphing quickly and without warning is upon us. This means doing all we can to be more efficient in the present, as well as nurturing readiness for growth in the future. This is no mean task. The volatility of our times creates several probable future states, and businesses must be equally prepared to succeed in any one of those. That is why it is critical to be flexible and avoid making choices today that may shut key avenues in the future, and to reduce concentration risks that can make the business less adaptable to new realities that can emerge in the times to come.  At Infosys, we understand what it takes to navigate this era of optionality. Through times rough and smooth, we have brought great focus to becoming better, becoming more efficient, and resilient in the present, while also securing our relevance in a progressive future. This has stood us in good stead. We understand what it takes to prepare for many eventualities, and we know our clients, our employees and you, our shareholders, count on us to be agile, adapt quickly and nimbly learn to thrive in any new reality. Not only are we committed to doing that, but we are also relentless in our efforts to set our clients up for success. A big part of that is helping them build their digital adaptability, so they can flex from strategy to execution in response to the fast-paced changes and intense uncertainty.  With the One Infosys approach to orchestrating our collective capabilities, we started our transformation to become a digital-first Live Enterprise bringing the same advantage of digital agility and resilience to our clients as well. Our disproportionate investments in cloud through Infosys Cobalt cloud solutions are helping our clients bring its advantages into every facet of their own business, from re-energizing operations, to driving innovations for growth. In addition, Infosys acquired Base life science A/S, a consulting and technology firm in the Life Science space industry in Europe to scale its digital transformation capabilities with cloud-based industry solutions. Even more significantly, the Company's cloud capabilities have created the foundation for our clients to build their AI-first business. The immense potential of AI and more recently, advances in generative AI, we know from our own experience of rapidly evolving into an AI-first enterprise, are not without their share of complexities. Several practical, ethical and intellectual property-related issues, when it comes to AI, remain unresolved. We also know that the path to scaling AI in the enterprise is far from simple. And yet, the AI-first strategy we’ve embraced is already working for us. We have redesigned the organization to judiciously balance people, technology and process while also executing work by segmenting into cognitive tasks. Today, we are able to bring to our global clientele, the same ability to accelerate business value and amplify human potential using AI technology with Infosys Topaz™.  While technology is core to everything we do, at its core, Infosys is a people company. Nurturing talent for the future is key to our continued success. We spare no efforts to provide our employees ample opportunities to learn and grow, while assuring them of a safe workplace that is fair, rewarding and free of discrimination and bias. The well-being and intrinsic motivation of our very talented, diverse and multicultural workforce will propel us forward. We recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year,  - 7 -  bringing our total headcount to over 340,000 employees, of which 39% are women. Upskilling and reskilling them all for careers of the future is a top priority for us. Over the year, a training ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning days for our employees. Our people track and manage their own digital skills aided by a comprehensive score, Digital Quotient. Through accelerated learning, when they complete certified courses and gain substantial experience in the skill set or technology, they qualify for Skill Tags. As employees gather more Skill Tags, multiple career pathways into exciting technology spaces open for them within the Infosys ecosystem. Bridge programs and intelligent platforms like Accelerate and Marketplace automatically match employees with the roles of their aspirations.  Matching a passion to deliver for clients and nurture our people is a commitment to the larger community. This is encapsulated in our shared purpose – to amplify human potential, and create the next opportunity for people, businesses and communities. It inspires us to be a sustainable business in every sense of the word. It drives us to nurture ambitious ESG aspirations, and to come together as One Infosys to realize it. From building a diverse workforce with strong, inclusive leaders to embracing positive climate change to helping our clients do the same and earning the trust of all our stakeholders through ethical corporate governance, we do our best to move us all forward. As a result of these efforts, and aligned to our ESG vision for 2030, we also continue to be responsive to the needs of society in new and innovative ways. As an example, digital skills taught through Infosys Springboard, Infosys’ flagship digital learning platform, is opening up a wealth of new opportunities for Brent Council’s business community in the UK, ensuring Brent businesses have the skills to thrive in the digital age. In a partnership with Harvard Business Publishing, students and young learners in India are now able to access resources including select Harvard Business Review articles, videos and podcasts, as well as 10 Harvard Management Mentor courses on Infosys Springboard. In the US, Infosys Springboard includes three learning tracks for the entire learner spectrum from K-12 through post- secondary and professional digital skills development. Today, we are empowering 8.5 million people, the world over, through our digital skilling initiatives.  With mindful and planned efforts, Infosys continues to be carbon neutral for the fourth successive year. Through the work of Infosys Foundation we support a variety of social causes, including creating positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and women empowerment. Internally within Infosys, our systems practices controls and procedures are well-governed not just to help us make effective decisions, but to comply with the law in letter and spirit, so we can effectively meet the needs and expectations of external stakeholders. This has always been the Infosys way.  The digital transformation of every industry and every aspect of life over the last several years, has laid the foundations for the opportunities that are to emerge. Our clients trust us to enable them not only to make the right digital investments but to mine these to deliver greater value for them through the future. After all, Infosys today is ranked in the top three IT services brands, and among the top 150 most valued brands globally. The challenge to keep moving ahead in these particularly dynamic times no doubt is immense. But the opportunity, and our capability and confidence to harness it is tremendous too. We are well-prepared for the future that may be unpredictable, but it is also up to us to build. On behalf of the Board. I want to assure you that Infosys is geared in every way with its rich track record, dedicated workforce, strong capabilities, premium brand and a clear strategy to provide exceptional service and value to all our stakeholders. I want to thank all our employees, clients, co-founders, and  - 8 -  governments of the countries and states that we operate in for their unstinting support over the years. Infosys has gone from strength to strength because of your backing. And to each of our shareholders, a a big thank you. Your commitment to Infosys, the people we serve and the businesses we drive, inspires us to bring our best to work for you every day. Our sincere thanks to all of you.   CEO’s address – Salil Parekh  Good afternoon, good evening, all of the shareholders. Welcome to the Annual General Meeting. Over the next few minutes, I will share with you an update from our business perspective how the year was.  We've had in this year a strong performance in a changing, evolving dynamic environment, and we have some leading capabilities in generative AI that I will also reference in the discussion.  First, in terms of the year, we had a good growth over 15%, our digital business grew very nicely at 25%. Our clients, which are over 100 million in revenue annually, were at 40. So good metrics and good dimensions to see the growth of the business. The operating margin was strong at 21%. And we had free cash flow of two and a half billion US dollars. We also had a good set of large deals, very strong 95 deals, each over 50 million in size, and the total of that at 9.8 billion, with 40% net new which helped us in building the foundation for the years to come. On the large client relationships, we have seen steadily growing numbers, 40 in the previous financial year, 38 before that, and 32 before that.  As we look at our industries, we had good growth across most of our industries. In fact, all of them were growing. A very strong performance in manufacturing and energy utilities. We are also good performance in retail and the communication sector.  Our employee base continues to expand at over 340,000 at the end of the year in March 2023. And of that, we also had a continued strong recruitment of college hires across the world, but more in India at over 50,000 college hires.  If I look at the financial performance, and we want to share this in rupees, each of our metrics, if you look at total revenues, this is in rupees a growth of 20% net profit, very solid, operating profit, very solid. We saw the operating cash flow and the free cash flow reducing from previous years, but at a very solid level, given the dynamic nature of the industry and the macro-economic environment last year.  In terms of our Balance Sheet, we continue to remain strong, debt-free and liquid. And that Balance Sheet is really the foundation of how we can position ourselves as a company into the future.  When we look at total shareholder return across five years, we've had a strong performance both between the share price increase and the dividend yield. In addition, we have returned over the last four years, over ₹69,000 crore to shareholders between the buyback and the regular dividend in each of the last years. This is very well-aligned with the policy that we had put in place. This represents just approximately 86% of our free cash flow in that past four financial years. Our total shareholder return as  - 9 -  we compare with other peers stands very well as we look across the period of December 17 to March 23.  Now one of the things we've been focused on over the past several years is building out deep capabilities, especially in the digital space. We had put together a strategy representing the pentagon with different elements of digital. Today, we are really delighted that we have a leader capability in 56 of these categories when we look at different external agencies, which ranked various companies on their digital ratings.  One of the most significant moves we've had in the past year, year and a half, two years was the push on the cloud. And that has been really the launch of Cobalt, which combines all of our cloud capabilities, whether it's infra as a service, software as a service, platform as a service, and in fact, software partnerships which come from many of these cloud providers.  We have built tremendous capabilities on our own with our partners. And today, we are in the leading position of driving cloud-driven business innovation, which supports the transformation of our clients when they go on to the cloud journey.  More recently, we have launched Topaz™. Topaz™ is really encompassing all of AI and especially generative AI capabilities. In generative AI, we have created leading capabilities using large language models, which are open source by nature, large language models, which come from different companies. We have today 50 active client projects where we are using generative AI. And this is becoming an increasing part of the new world, which is going to be defined on an AI-first basis.  Here, we've also built a very strong group of ecosystem partners, which we work with on AI and also on generative AI. It’s not just generative AI, it's on AI operations on vision areas, several AI startups and the hyperscalers and how they are leveraging the AI capabilities. We believe this is really the foundation Topaz and generative AI offer large transformation, which will go into the future as the world changes and leverages AI and generative AI.  One of the most critical reasons why we've had a strong performance this past year and over the past few years, is the concept we put in place of One Infosys. Here, all of our employees work directly for the benefit of our clients across all boundaries, departments, function. We are both focused on new transformation work and making sure that all of the work is getting delivered to our clients, leveraging all of that capability as one single Infosys, keeping the clients’ interests first in our mind.  With that, I will conclude. First, the financial year 2023 was a strong year for our business. We have positioned the Company to work with our clients for digital transformation, but also more and more as they look at cost efficiency and the automation programs. We have developed a strong set of capabilities in generative AI, and overall in an AI-first approach via Topaz™. We have already extremely strong capabilities on cloud, which is based on Cobalt, which our clients are leveraging. And One Infosys is really the foundation of all of this work that we do within the Company and for the benefit of our clients. I want to in conclusion, thank you all of our shareholders, for your continued trust and support in the Company. With this sort of a foundation and your trust with us, we see a future which is  - 10 -  successful future for Infosys, working with more clients and enabling more of our employees for a future in an AI-first technology-driven world. Thank you. And back to you, Nandan.  Nandan Nilekani  Thank you, Salil. I now request Manikantha, the Company Secretary, to provide a summary of the auditor's report. 	21004		1	 A Company has completed the open market share buyback on February 13, at an average price of approximately ₹1,539 per share compared to the maximum buyback price of ₹1,850 per share.  Operating margin for the year remained healthy at 21%.  A big part of that is helping them build their digital adaptability, so they can flex from strategy to execution in response to the fast-paced changes and intense uncertainty.  With this sort of a foundation and your trust with us, we see a future which is  - 10 -  successful future for Infosys, working with more clients and enabling more of our employees for a future in an AI-first technology-driven world.

I thank all the members,  - 5 -  colleagues on the Board, auditors and the management team for joining this meeting over video conference.

1108	\infosys\june-23.pdf	A.G.S. Manikantha 	  Thank you, ma’am.  May I now request the next shareholder, Mr. Shailesh?  Shailesh, Sir, kindly go ahead and ask your question.  Shailesh  Yes, Sir. Respected Chairman, distinguished directors, the management team members and the members of Infosys.  Sir, let me first congratulate the entire Company for getting one more year of excellent results financially and in all other activities. Sir, the presentation by the Chairman was excellent. And it was further supplemented by the Managing Director. Sir, I have become wiser, as far as our company’s working is concerned and more satisfied than what I was. Now, I wish to also appreciate the services of  - 13 -  the secretarial department, which has enabled me to participate in this meeting. Sir, with this, I would like to ask two or three questions. Sir, my first question is that there are frequent changes in technology, particularly in recent times, and this trend is likely to continue. Sir, what I would like to understand is how fast our employees get adjusted to this changing situation in such a fast way. Are we encountering any problem in this particular situation? Sir, my second question is regarding the world economic growth, which is likely to remain low in the current year also. Sir, our business has a direct relation with the GDP, world GDP. Sir, my question is that I'm sure some of our businesses must have also been affected, not canceled but delayed. Sir, what I would like to know is which of the verticals of our business has remained unaffected or least affected and which vertical has been affected to the maximum. And Sir, my last question is regarding the security, cyber security. Our business is so very sensitive and data preservation etc. is extremely important. And we also hear many cases that this safety and security is breached. Sir, what I would like to know is what steps we are taking in this particular field. And Sir, lastly, before I end, I would like to appreciate the excellent work being done by Infosys Foundation under the leadership of Mrs. Sudha Murty. I would also like to add that all our promoters in their individual capacity also, they are working to the society in a very big way. Well, the nation is proud of all of you. And I hope you will continue to make the progress as you have been doing in the last so many years. With all this, my pranaam and best wishes to all of you. 	2392		2	 Sir, my question is that I'm sure some of our businesses must have also been affected, not canceled but delayed.

1110	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Shrenik Mehta  	 [Missing audio] Mehta from port city of Jamnagar. Age-wise, I'm 70+, and I'm a minority shareholder. Academically I am M.Com LLB, advocate, and I'm a long-term investor in share market also, as well as I'm a sub broker on NSE. That is my short introduction. My DP ID is IN30097410028000.  Our beloved Chairman, Nandan Nilekani Saheb, Salil Parekh Sir, the Board of Directors, Mr. Manikantha, our Company Secretary and his secretarial team. First of all, I would like to convey my thanks to all of you for giving me an opportunity to speak at the 42nd AGM. My questions are: Sir, it is said by our very good, loved Motilal Oswal Financial Services, share market ke baare mein bola jaata hai, bhaav Bhagwan hai. [It is said about the share market, that price is God]. If so if I translate into English, shaayad [maybe] Nandan Nilekani doesn't know Gujarati, price is like, for share market, price is like a God. Now I am coming to the Infosys. From all-time high, today, our Nifty has again touched back. And IT index is minus 8% whereas our Infosys price are minus 22% as on today. That much underperformance, Nandan Nilekani, Salil Parekh Sir, and Manikantha, our company's price has done. And [unclear audio], I have put much more weightage in my total portfolio of my total holding. So it is quite concerning to me.  Now, let me come to second point. Sir, during last three-four AGMs, me and other shareholders are requesting the Board of Directors to do buyback through tender route. Then again also, after so many requests, you have not accepted our request and last buy back was through open market operation. So, we don't get direct benefit. Now Manikantha, question to you. If I'm not mistaken, from 1st April  - 14 -  2024, recently Sebi has passed an order that from 1st April 2024, all buyback will be through tender route. Kindly confirm whether my understanding is correct or not, because personally, me and my Jamnagar Chamber of Commerce have represented to SEBI that buyback should be compulsorily by tender route, not by open market operations. Kindly confirm in your answer.  I think dividend policy, I think 85% you are returning back, so, I don't have much question about it.  But now, Mr. Salil Parekh and Nandan Nilekani. What about organic growth and inorganic growth for future? About Salil Parekh’s address, much talk about artificial intelligence but as I'm a student of commerce and law, I don't understand much but as a shareholder, I would like to know, will artificial intelligence support our working or it will distract our working? Please throw some light in simple language, who can understand, a student of commerce and law.  Manikantha, now question is to you. Every time, I have to cast my vote through these my demat account. When I go, that NSDL site shows my email and my mobile number is not registered. Then I lodge a complaint with my deposited participant, Marwadi Shares. They say we have already registered your number. Then I lodge complaint with NSDL. They say we have also registered your mobile number and email id perfectly. Toh bola problem kahaan hai, Sir? [Sir, where is the problem?] So, why e-voting site says so? Uske kehne ka matlab yeh hai, NSDL ka. [What the NSDL is saying is…] I got reply from NSDL, ke jo aapka transfer agent hai, transfer and register, KFin Tech, woh puri tarah se hamara data uthathe nahin hai. Iski wajah se aapka email and mobile number does not show. [Your register and transfer agent, KFin Tech does not take the data completely. This is why your email and mobile number do not show] while you want to do e-voting. Phir unhone koi special password bhi de diya. [Then they gave me some special password.] Then I was able to cast my vote and register myself.  And last point, Sir, you are doing so much of Corporate Social Responsibility work. I'm from Jamnagar district. It is my humble suggestion that do some corporate social responsibility in my district of Jamnagar, in consultation with Member of Parliament, Mrs. Poonamben Maadam. Thank you for giving me an opportunity and as a shareholder, I'm quite happy. But, my price, share price of Infosys are not going and you are not doing buyback by tender route. So, these are my two grievances, please. Thank you all. 	4255		1	 And IT index is minus 8% whereas our Infosys price are minus 22% as on today.

1112	\infosys\june-23.pdf	A.G.S. Manikantha 	  Yes, Sir. You are audible.  - 15 -   Kaushik  Yeah. So good evening, everyone. I am honored to have the opportunity to speak with you all today. I want to start by thanking the Board of Directors for giving me this chance to address you all once again. As many of you will remember, my name is Kaushik Sowcar, and I'm a chartered accountant from Mumbai. I have been facing physical challenges due to dystonia, which has affected half of my body paralyzed, impacted my right hand, my right leg and speech. However, I have not let this challenge impact my passion for accounting. However, I do need your support to continue to be self-reliant. I have been reaching out to you for last few years. But it seems that my request has gone unheard. I understand that you may be having been busy with other things, important things. But I would like to know the reason why my request has not been given the attention it deserves. I want to make it clear that I'm not looking for any freebies, free money. I'm simply asking for help to ensure that I continue to work to the best of my abilities. As a practicing chartered accountant, I value independence and self- reliance, and I hope that you can appreciate my desire to maintain the independence. Thank you for considering my request. I strongly believe that with your support, I can make significant contribution to our organization and positively impact society. I eagerly await your response and sincerely appreciate the time and attention you have given me today. If you're interested and willing, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to meet you in person. Thank you. Thank you so much. 	1643		1	 But it seems that my request has gone unheard.

[Respected leaders, Board members, and fellow shareholders, who are all present on video conference today, namaskar from me, Santosh Kumar Saraf. Namaskar also especially to Manikantha and team and thanks to them for enabling this.]  Sabse pehle dhanyavaad deta hoon, Sir, is saal aapne jo [unclear audio] jo dividend diya hai, who high dividend hai, iske liye dhanyavaad deta hoon. Doosra, Sir, main aapko iske liye bhi dhanyavaad deta hoon ke aapke yahan 39.4% women employees hai, out of 3,40,000. Aur iske saath dukh is baat ka hain ki women employees toh 40% hai, female directors sirf 12% hai. Toh main chahunga future mein ek director aur laake isko kam se kam aage badhane ka koshish karenge. Jaise aapne kahaan women empowerment ke liye aap kaam kar rahen hai, toh directors ke andar women empowerment nahin dikh raha hai. Iska dhyan rakhenge, Sir.   - 16 -  [First of all, thank you, Sir, you gave high dividend this year, thank you for this. Secondly, I would also like to thank you because Infosys has 39.4% women employees out of a total of more than 3,40,000 employees. But, it is also sad that even when women employees make up 40%, female directors on the Board is only 12%. So, I hope that in the future, you will hire a woman director to increase this. You said you were working for women empowerment, but this women empowerment is not seen among directors. Hope you will keep this in mind, Sir.]   Sir, last year, aapke active clients 1,872 hai, Sir, Toh isme abhi new client kitne hai? [unclear audio] Agar aapke pass report hai, toh batane ki cheshta kariyega Sir.  [Sir, last year, you had 1,872 active clients. How many of these were new clients. If you have the reports, please share with us.]  Sir, how many employees work from home? Percentage kya hai, unke numbers kya hain jo abhi work from home kar rahe hai, Sir? Aur Sir, iske saat mein yeh hai, Sir, ke aapke yahaan jo buyback jo aapne kiya, uska value, how many billion? Aapne highest price mein, 1539 mein buyback kiya Sir lekin humein mila nahin, milta toh aaj humein kaafi help hogi. Toh future mein, hum chahunga Sir aap buyback jab bhi karen, toh is route se karen, tender ki route se, jaise Wipro wale kar rahen hai. Usse aap actual benefit jo shareholder ko dena chahenge, who unko milega. Otherwise kya hain ki immediate jo sell karte hai, unko mil jaata hai. Hum jo bache long-term investors, jo aapka shares bechna nahin chahte hain bazaar mein, who loser hote hai. Sir, iske baare mein zaroor vichar kariyega. [unclear audio] Zaroor vichar kariyega, jo aapke loyal shareholder hai, woh toh bazaar mein maal bechte nahin hai. Actually, unko tender ki through agar milta hai, toh benefit hota hai, otherwise benefit nahin hota.  [Sir, how many employees are working from home. What is the percentage of those who are currently working from home? Also, Sir, what is the value of the buyback you have done? Your buyback was done at the highest price of 1,539 but we didn’t get it. IF we had got it, it would have been good. In future, I hope you will do the buyback through the tender route, like Wipro does. By doing this, the actual benefit that you want to give shareholders will reach them. Else, whoever sells immediately will gain. For us, your long-term investors, who don’t want to sell in the open market, we become losers. Sir, please think about this because your loyal shareholders, they won’t sell in the open market. If they get it through the tender route, they will benefit. Otherwise, they don’t get any benefit.]  Main zyaada say nahin loonga. Sir, main yeh chahunga ki is saal kitne new employees aapne add kiye hai, unke numbers kya hain aur Sir, unke female percentage kya hai. Zyaada samay nahin lete hai, ek baar phir hamare jitne bhi director hai, jitne bhi adhikari hain aur jitne bhi shareholders jo video conference pe hai, unko aur unke parivaar ko shubhkaamnayein deta hoon. Aur Bhagwan se prarthana karta hoon, jo 2023 ka financial year hai, who sabhi ke liye healthy, wealthy, prosperous ho.

I would also like to know how many new employees were added this year, and what was the percentage of female employees among them? I once again wish the people on the call and their families all the best and wish the financial year 2023 will make them healthy, wealthy and prosperous.

I'm from Surat, Gujarat. My DP ID is IN303028. First of all, I would like to congratulate each and every stakeholder of my Company on performing tremendously well, outperforming the peers and posting robust numbers, both on Q-o-Q and Y-o-Y basis. Sir, every year it is an honor and a memorable moment to get an opportunity to have an insightful conversation with you on different aspects. I would also like to acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of corporate secretarial department. Some of my questions which I would request you to address are first, apart from the cloud capabilities and differentiated digital services, which segment might be the third pillar to the stellar growth in the coming years. Second, what is my Company's strategy of maintaining higher ROE despite suffering from the issue of lower margins? Third, how is my Company going to improve its free cash flow conversion in this particular fiscal year? Fourth, apart from leveraging more on generative AI capability, what are the steps that my Company is taking to improve the productivity within the company? Fifth, considering the company's BFSI segment has only 2% exposure in USA’s regional banks, which segment of yours do you think shall be highly and which segment will be least impacted by the case, case being that US goes in recession? Six, what according to you, shall be the role of IT services five years down the line factoring in all the recent developments of AI and many such things related to it? Seven, what steps has my company taken for the well-being of its employees in this last fiscal year? I wish all the best to my Company for this current fiscal year.	1799		2	 Second, what is my Company's strategy of maintaining higher ROE despite suffering from the issue of lower margins.

I am Shruti Saraogi, a proud shareholder of Infosys, folio number 300693 joining in from Kolkata, and a member of the Kolkata chapter of Millennium Mams. I have two questions, Sir. An important part of our operations is human resources. As we know, there is a shortage and attrition rates are high in the industry. Do you think it  - 18 -  would be a good HR policy to provide accommodation? Theoretically, if we put up a campus in Mysore with the new Mysore-Bangalore highway, the distance is only one hour. This could be on the lines of the GIFT city in Gujarat, where all facilities are available. This would help reduce attrition rates. Please share your views on that. Secondly, … about AI replacing humans in many work areas and being a threat. On which side of the opinion spectrum are you and why? Thank you so much, Sir. 	898		1	 I am Shruti Saraogi, a proud shareholder of Infosys, folio number 300693 joining in from Kolkata, and a member of the Kolkata chapter of Millennium Mams.

I’m a minority shareholder, actually. So I’m also a software developer for around 20 years. So my question is related, something related to generative AI. I had to ask this actually, I couldn’t sleep. So basically, I’ve been using this and I know the power of this actually. So it increases productivity by around 30 to around 90%, depending on how it is used. So, the thing is that, which Chairman Nandan Nilekani Sir and Salil Parekh Sir have told about Infosys Topaz™ and  - 21 -  externally how clients are using it and are needing that. But, my question is internal looking. So if you don’t adapt to this, this is going to be a threat, actually to our Company, actually. So maybe this is already getting reflected in the market. I’m not really sure. But what is the plan, short-term and long- term of Infosys in leveraging this technology for increasing productivity and quality? And, there are a lot of implications to this. So what is our Company doing related with this? So it’s a hard question, but I had to ask this because, yeah, this is on top of my mind, actually. But thanks once again, for this opportunity. 	1248		1	 So it’s a hard question, but I had to ask this because, yeah, this is on top of my mind, actually.

1135	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Sadananda Shastri  	  Good evening, I'm Sadananda Shastri from Bangalore. My number is 11702201.  First of all, I thank the Board for having given a nice performance. But however, a profit growth of growth is 1,962 crore, which is lesser than earlier years. I'm sorry to say shareholders are losing dividend benefits in the form of TDS that even though they are not liable for it. It may be due to lack of the guidance from the Company's team concerned. Lot of confusions are being cropped up in submitting Form 15 H. What particulars the coordinators team is required, we do not know. Neither they will disclose it nor rectify it. With this, I have lost many thousands. During our earlier years, proper guidance from the team is needed, Sir. Sir, I will go by page-wise from the report, purely from the report, I will not deviate anything. [Unclear audio]  Report page no.19, in revenue geography, India has secured the least place – 2.6% How do you uplift this? Is there any negligence in the Indian market?  Page no. 22, in the column Term Ending Date of Chairman, you have used the abbreviation NA. How do you justify the word NA when all other directors are having ending date?  Is the word NA appropriate?  Page no. 45, it is pitiable to note revenue growth is negative of 0.4. How the company will bring it up to positive in the current year?  Page no. 46, you have said 1,357 employees disclosed their disability. What is its meaning? Does it not affect the image of the Company?  Page no. 58, Board’s report, an excellent amount of income of 268 crore is taken out from profit towards comprehensive item to make round the other figure to 23,000. What is this item, Sir?   - 23 -  Page no. 163, in transfer of reserves, it is said that you have not transferred any amount to reserves. Does it not speak about the stability of the company?  Page no. 66, that is resignation of directors. Many stalwarts like Mrs. Kiran Majumdar, Mr. Ravi Kumar, Mr. Mohit, etc. are leaving the Company. How do you safeguard the image of the Company?  Page no. 70, out of 98 subsidiaries, some like Unit 15 – Shanghai, 33 – Base life, 38 – Malaysia, 53 – Turkey, 88 – Germany, are incurring loss. How do you struggle hard to bring these to a positive line?  However, Panaya is shining now, thank you very much for that.  Page no. 81, in the remuneration of managerial personnel, 287 crore, more powerful [unclear audio] profit. Why can't the personnel adopt the ethics and follow the other company's CEO sacrifice in the interest of company first as well as company's employees?  Page no. 83, congrats for the company’s second place in top 10 in remuneration. In what way this rank benefits to the Company? Do we see first rank in the next year?  Page no. 219, Balance Sheet, why there is a large variation in investments in standalone and consolidated, that is, 23,686 crore versus 12,569 crore.  Lastly, page no. 301, in other expenses, 130 crore increase in credit loss. Can the company adopt strategies to reduce interest to nil, whether this would be a hit for the current year profit?

1146	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Namaste Sir.  	  Salil Parekh ji, Nilanjan Roy ji and Manikantha ji, and all the other directors, independent directors, auditors, scrutinizer of this AGM and my fellow shareholders of this video conference. Good evening. Namaste. Sir, my name is Redappa Gundluru. I'm from Hyderabad. I'm a financial advisor with the Motilal Oswal. Sir, as a shareholder, I'm very happy about the company’s performance for financial year 2022. As usual, Sir, thank you so much. Chairman Sir, you have given very good speech about my company’s performance during the last financial year. I would like to share my experiences about the physical AGM. Nandan Sir and Salil Sir, you are both the backbone of my company. I have very good memories and very good photographs from physical AGM 2018-19. Nandan Sir is a very good person. I have requested for a photograph, and he immediately accepted. He asked the security people to allow and took the photograph. It was a wonderful moment of my life, Sir. Thank you so much. That's the reason I'm waiting for this AGM for the last one year. Thank you so much.  Sir, I would like to thank this corporate governance. Earlier, a shareholder spoke about the corporate governance. I'm not agreeing with that. Our corporate governance is very wonderful. Ethically, accountability, transparency of accounts, everything is there, Chairman Sir. Please keep it up and special thanks and kudos to my Company Secretary, Manikantha and all the KMPs of my company.  Nandan sir, I wanted to highlight the work you are doing for the society and the IIT technology. Wonderful, Sir. Nowadays, IIT students are very much needed to develop our country. I congratulate you for this wonderful and generous donation to the IIT for supporting the infrastructure and improvements, research and deep technology startup ecosystems. It shows you are the technology person. My company is technology, but you are developing another society for IIT students. Really, I am touched, Sir. Wonderful decision by my company’s Board. Thank you so much and congratulations Sir.  Despite of adverse of macros, enterprises continue to reevaluate to their cost to structure and strengthen their business to resilience. Additionally, they are adopting technology investments to foster agility. Sir, there’s no need to tell about my company’s financials. Wonderful, strong and consistent performance. Thanks for dividend. Congratulations to the wonderful team, the CEO team and technical members. All people are wonderful, Sir.   - 27 -  Sir, we have received very wonderful awards. Congrats for many more awards and achievements. Also, CSR is very wonderful, Sir. No need to say about our work with the Foundation and I have also gone through the all the separate annual report for the Foundation. Thank you so much, Sir.  Mr. Chairman, I have three questions:  First question, Sir – what is the future vision for the next of couple of years?  And in last few quarters, Infosys has seen high profile exits at Delivery level. Since high-level exists are at Delivery level, could you potentially halt project timelines in the short-term?  Third question, Sir – Financial year 2024 revenue guidance was 4-7% Y-o-Y. CCA optically looks soft versus peers. Does the company see at revising any guidance for the coming quarters?  Another question, Sir. Any updates on mega deals which are 500-million US dollar?. Please comment. Infosys is at the forefront of adoption for technologies. What is the current percentage top-up line and what is the growth expected in financial year 2024-25?  Yeah, I have a couple of questions. I'm going to conclude. Thank you.  Sir, another question. Infosys margins may remain subdued over the next three years - financial years 2024 to 2026. What are the levers available to get back to financial year 2016 or 2022 levels?  Another question – strong growth in digital revenue but at the same time, a decline in core and non- digital revenue. How does the company plan to maintain growth in digital and non-digital revenues?  Another question – the management sounded cautious about the outlook demand scenarios from North America during Q4 financial year 2023. How is the outlook after Q1 FY24?  Final question Sir – In Q4 financial year 2023, there was weakness in Retail, Hi-Tech, Financial Services and Telecom segments due to unexpected ramp down. So, what is the outlook after Q1 financial year 2024? These are my observations. And I have already submitted all the resolutions and thank the Company Secretary department, Manikantha and other employees and teams for the wonderful support for the smooth functioning. Thanks once again, Mr. Chairman Sir. I'm happy to see you healthy and fine. And all the Board of Directors, I wish all the best and hopefully, in the coming financial year, under your leadership, my company will achieve many more higher awards and recognitions and many more milestones under the leadership of my one and only leader, Nandan Nilekani. He’s the strong pillar of my company with the support of all the Board of Directors. Thank you, Salil Sir, in the last five years, very wonderful, you are hardworking Sir. Thank you so much for giving this opportunity. I wish good health to all the Board of Directors. Thank you, Manikantha ji. 	5264		2	 Congratulations to the wonderful team, the CEO team and technical members.

1149	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Manoj Kumar  	  First question is what is our future outlook on core? Number one, how are we are geared up to tackle upcoming recession in the US and European market and adverse impact of foreign currencies? Second one is what are our plans to achieve sustainable financial growth and next point is return on earning targets for upcoming three to five years. That is what I just want to understand. And another one is that question has already been answered I think. How are we geared up for the technical disruption?. So that, with Salil Sir’s good presentation, I got the answer well in advance.  Last question is while going through the Balance Sheet and P&L, I was just wondering what is the reason for 84% increase in travel expenses, and what is the reason for 60% increase in cost of software Y-o-Y. I found that these two are major factors which have brought gone down our profitability by 2%.  Although, there is an increase in revenue from operations of 20%, our PBT has dropped by 2%. I feel these are the two major causes – 84% increase in traveling expense and 60% increase in cost of software Y-o-Y. So, I just want to understand the reason for that. Thank you.  	1163		1	First question is what is our future outlook on core.  Although, there is an increase in revenue from operations of 20%, our PBT has dropped by 2%.

1150	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Thank you, Sir. 	  May I now request Mr. Srikantha? Sir, kindly go ahead and ask your question.  Srikantha  Respected Chairman, MD, Board of directors, employees of Infosys and fellow shareholders, namaskar.  So, I was in for a very pleasant surprise when I met my auditor few days ago while I was filing my IT returns. The IT portal has been done so well, so effective by our own company, that earlier we had to give all the details to our auditor, like what are our earnings, expenses and everything. But now, to my surprise, everything is captured there. Even a small amount of ₹25 dividend from a company is captured there. This is fantastic. My congratulations and applause to the team who have done the hard  - 29 -  work here. And in fact, I remember last year, there were a lot of glitches and trouble, but you're able to overcome everything and this is quite wonderful. I think all the auditors would be very happy. With that, I have only two questions.  Sir, Infosys is known for giving special dividends on reaching each and every milestone. I remember when Infosys reached 25 years’ operations, they declared a fantastic special dividend. Likewise for 30 years. Now that you have completed 40 years, I am yet to hear something of that. So please, please do that. And coming to the question. This question was asked by a few shareholders regarding this buyback. See when Infosys announced a buyback of ₹1,850 per share, and it went to the market for the buyback and got it around ₹1,500 or so, why was this done? See, instead of going for a buyback, you could have awarded the shareholders with a special dividend. These are my two questions.

See when Infosys announced a buyback of ₹1,850 per share, and it went to the market for the buyback and got it around ₹1,500 or so, why was this done.	over increase missing mistake changed done clear here nothing money statement today continue success return good saying said playing comments right correct rise yes progress announcement contribute comment announced unclear positive doing	acquisitions over complete participate increase answered missing there statements mistake done changed clear here invest grow remarks resigned returned website confidential nothing questions money great name statement today continue decide return problems good saying said comments fantastic right dividends correct yes progress contribute comment announced not unclear positive one history doing

1152	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Bharat Raj  	  Good evening, Mr. Chairman. I'm calling from Hyderabad. First of all, thanks to Mr. Manikantha for arranging a wonderful VC. Sir, first of all, congrats to the Board for completing $15 billion company. I'm very proud. Under the leadership of Mr. Salil, we are doing wonderful. Salil Sir, you successfully completed five years. I hope you remember at the physical AGM, you successfully completed three years like a marriage contract. Now, you've completed five years. Sir, I wish you that you retire from my company. I am telling you in advance that you should retire from my company. Under your leadership, Mr. Nilanjan Roy, wonderful performance and he's taking care of the dividend payouts and everything. I know how painful it is for him to arrange all these funds, but he is very maturely and very intelligently handling the financials, Sir. Thank you.  Sir, I thank my Chairman Mr. Nilekani for giving  ₹350 crore to the IIT. Wonderful Sir. This is the beginning in the country. I hope more entrepreneurs will come and contribute something to the society. Regarding this dividend payout, thank you very much Sir.  When ex-CEO Mr. Vishal Sikka came, he gave two bonuses. Mr. Parekh, I’m expecting some something from you Sir. When can we expect bonus for you, Sir? Please look up to the bonus, Sir. Stop buyback and take care of at least one bonus because you successfully completed five years. At least this year, declare one bonus. One more thing. I want to bring your notice, Sir. You are a great leader. There is something I have seen in the Balance Sheet in page number 83. There are 78 sexual harassment cases. Last year, it was 25. It jumped to 78. I don't know what is happening under your leadership, Sir. Please look into the issue. Next time this shouldn’t be happening. Discrimination cases are also 111. I'm very sorry Sir. You're a very good leader. If anything happens, somebody will point at  - 30 -  you. My intention is that my leader, my Dhoni, the captain of our team should not be in this position. You are the best leader, and you are captain of my team. We will always support you. I support everything for you and all the resolutions, Sir. Mr. Chairman, I requested Mysore visit and you successfully arranged it. Now, I am requesting Mangalore visit. Whoever is attending the AGM, please arrange a Mangalore DC visit only for those. In 2019 physical AGM, you said you will look into the issue. Now COVID is also over. So, whoever is attending the AGM, please arrange a visit to Mangalore and inform to Manikantha too, Sir. We hope we will visit next year for physical AGM.  Our prime minister is going all over the world Sir but why is my company not giving an opportunity to arrange a physical AGM? Next year, I hope we will have a physical AGM, get together and great gala, Sir. We will be happy to see you and meet personally. Once again, all the best for the upcoming year and my best wishes to the entire Manikantha’s team. God bless you. Thank you for giving this opportunity.

First question is - Infosys donated to Open AI a few years back when they were a non-profit. Now they're incorporated for for-profit subsidiary. Is Infosys having a stake in that? If yes, how much does Infosys have? How is Open AI supporting Infosys as one of the early investors or donors? This question is from Ganesh Gopi.  The answer is yes, Infosys was among the earliest supporters of the non-profit Open AI. And, we had made a donation several years back. We have no stake in the for-profit of the company. But we are delighted by the success that Open AI has achieved, and we wish them very good future with all the outstanding AI work that they're doing.  Second question – what are the disruptions you foresee for industry in the near future, from	1775		1	 While we provide the answers to the questions shortly, I would request the team to display questions received on the webchat and play videos which showcase the work done by Infosys during the past year.

1161	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Sreenivasa Rao Kilaru. 	  It really is a very exciting time. There are a lot of changes happening in the world of technology. For the last decade, we had first whole migration for digital way of doing things using smartphones and so on. And then following that, we had the big wave of Cloud and Cloud migration, where Infosys plays with products like Cobalt. Recently, of course, there's the whole interest in AI and generative AI. Infosys is well-placed there with Topaz. So, all these changes are happening all at the same time. And we expect that in the next few years, all our global customers will have to fundamentally do a lot of changes to their technology and architecture. To leverage this, you will have to do things more efficient and become more cost-effective. At the same time, they will have to leverage all this, create transformation to create better business and better consumer experience. We're also at the beginning of many other mega trends. First is the whole green transition which includes decarbonization, which means that whole energy system for the world will migrate for the next several decades, from a hydrocarbon-based future to a renewable future means that the way we produce energy will go from having monolithic producers to millions of small producers, which has a huge impact on the grid means that instead of petrol pumps we will have gas stations, we will have charging stations. So, there's a huge decarbonization or climate change which is going to affect all our businesses. And of course, thanks to the geopolitics, people are now looking at how to make their supply chains more resilient, and allowing people to have multiple options, where they can produce and how it is shaped. Then of course, thanks, when also because of the whole security issues, you have issues of how to deal with cybersecurity, we have issues of how countries are going to become more able to defend themselves and so on. And of course, there's the whole telecom thing happening through the rollout of the 5g network. So, there are many, many disruptions or changes happening in the future. Now, I want to assure all of you that we at Infosys are fully seized of this, we are keeping a close eye on this. And we will make sure that we  - 35 -  understand these trends and changes and what they mean for our clients. We make sure that we can bring them best ideas and support that they can navigate the future successfully.   Third question is from the Nani, who is a member of this Millennium Mans, Calcutta chapter, seems to be very strong group. She says, Sir, the world is divided as operations of AI is concerned. So which side do you belong?  [No audio]  And deep fakes, it will affect our elections and our politics. So, there are many short-term issues with AI. And of course, there are some people who believe that long-term AI could almost have an extinction risk for our humanity. Yet, Infosys believes that AI has many possible powerful use cases. And therefore, we will use AI using our Topaz infrastructure and our AI-first thinking to bring about transformation of our clients. And we will do that using responsible AI. We’ll make sure that the AI follows regulatory rules, privacy rules, and the accuracy rules that we need. So, we believe that AI can be a force for good with the appropriate guardrails. So, my question and answers, I now hand over to Salil to take his questions. 	3394		2	 First is the whole green transition which includes decarbonization, which means that whole energy system for the world will migrate for the next several decades, from a hydrocarbon-based future to a renewable future means that the way we produce energy will go from having monolithic producers to millions of small producers, which has a huge impact on the grid means that instead of petrol pumps we will have gas stations, we will have charging stations.

1162	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Salil Parekh 	  Thanks, Nandan. Now, to the questions that we have received from the web chat, I have a few that I will go through.  The first from Mr. Vipul Kumar Shah. Will generative AI result in loss of jobs for coders or will it increase productivity, and what will be the impact on the profit of the company?  Generative AI has a huge potential for impact with our clients. We see a lot of different projects that are already coming into the work that we're doing. We are working with both generative AI platforms, large language models, which are open source, and we are working with generative AI with different companies have put forward. We see productivity improvements, depending on different areas that could range from 10% to 30%. We also see a huge level of new type of work, for example, generative AI leveraging within companies, large areas of information, which are then sourced through for better usage. That data being used more precisely, for their purposes. We see that in vision, we see that in software development in various areas. So, our view is most times when new technologies are coming, that they have an impact which changes how our clients look at new technologies, and that expands the type of work that those new technologies are providing within clients. And there's also the need to of course, look at technologies over the past generations and making sure that they are integrated in. So overall, we see an exciting future that is unleashed by generative AI.  Next question, Mr. Krishnendu Chakraborty. What will be Infosys view on future complete remote office or Metaverse, or similar platform?   - 36 -  Here, we have really built a flexible approach to how our employees are working. Over the last several months and quarters, we've seen a steady increase in employees that are starting to come back into the office. We also see that there are office locations in newer areas that we've set up, for example in Vizag, for example in the Navi Mumbai, where we are seeing more and more employees starting to come into these offices. We believe over time, there will be more need for social connect and social capital. There are several clients who are requesting that the teams be working on campus for their projects and that is happening. And this is going on all around the world and within India for our employees.  The next question from Mr. Munirathnamma Raghavendra. Where do we see Infosys in the next five years across different sectors, and the impact of AI into those sectors?  Earlier what I shared on generative AI and Topaz; Topaz really has become the platform, the foundation on which all of our AI and generative AI work is being done. We have tremendous level of large templates, use cases and real client examples beyond generative AI on AI, as well. Each of these are impacting different industries in different ways. We see, for example, Financial Services industries are leveraging AI in a fast way to rework what their internal approach to data and information is looking like. We see a different approach coming in Telecom, we see a different approach coming in Utilities. And overall, we see the industries are all getting impacted in a way that will leverage more and more of AI, which is supporting data analytics, machine learning and overall generative AI into the future.   Our next question from Mr. Sajit Chellappan – What is the long-term strategy for work from home policy for India-based employees?  Again, building on the previous point, our focus so far has been to make sure that we have a flexible approach for our employees. And we've seen a tremendous positive reception from the employees all around India on this. We are making sure that the employees have the ability to work from home or work hybrid. In some cases, where clients are requiring it, we have employees and teams that are working within the campus. On a long-term basis, we see a mix of where people will work, where there will be a need for increased social capital to connect with people, to work with teams, to do new work jointly, and for mentoring and coaching of individuals. And we see the flexibility that will enable more and more employees to be part of the work system. So, we are seeing that as really the way the future is evolving. And we are also keeping a close track of how our employees are relating to it, and how our clients are relating to it to build this strategy as we go ahead.  Next question from Mr. Vasudeva Rao. The question is, why are we not going for big acquisitions. COVID provided a good opportunity to acquire. Any plans in the future to go for big acquisitions?  So here, our view is we have a very good balance sheet and a good position overall, with respect to how we can look at acquisitions. Our approach has been to look at things which will fit in strategically within a digital or Cloud or AI framework. And then look at what will be the way to integrate it, then we look at the culture of the company. And then we look at what is the method of running it day to day once the company has been acquired. Based on those, of course the price value, we make the  - 37 -  decision. We’re here today, looking across different sizes of acquisitions. As a potential company falls into the right buckets for those, we will continue to do acquisitions. We've also been mindful, as we've seen over the last two years, where some of the acquisitions that were initially of high value, the value has come down. So, we are now looking more carefully at the future of acquisitions.  Our next question from [unclear audio] – what are the growth opportunities in Middle East and South America? And what are the current revenue percentages in in these markets?  We have a presence in Middle East and South America. Those are low revenue percentages. We've taken a focus in the past few years, where it's been much more on North America, European, and other parts of Asia Pacific, specifically Australia and New Zealand to develop those markets. We've also built strategic joint ventures in Japan and in Singapore to expand our markets. We are now looking at the future where there's a huge set of opportunities in the Middle East. And we want to scale that market up as well. And we will see more and more focus into the Middle East as we go ahead.   Our next question is from [unclear audio] – when will our investments in Metaverse start yielding revenue? How large do we expect revenue stream in percentage terms?  As you may be aware, we have created what we call the Metaverse Foundry, which is widely accepted within our client base. Today, we are seeing more and more use cases and interest in that. However, it is at an early stage today of development. And we see over time, more and more interest in this.  Next question is from Mr. Ramesh Babu Satrasala – The question is because of the slowdown in the economy for software and export, how is the impact on profit and fresh hires in the coming quarters?  So here, the overall demand environment, as was discussed earlier, is changed. With the global economy slowing down and the GDP rate slowing down, we see now more attention of clients moving from digital and cloud transformation to cost efficiency and automation. And we are fortunate that even in the consolidation area, we have a lot of opportunities that are coming in. We just announced you may have seen a few weeks ago a memorandum of understanding with BP, the original British Petroleum, where there's a huge benefit to Infosys from consolidation and a tremendous opportunity in the future. We have also announced jointly with our client just a couple of days ago, a very large transformation and efficiency program in the Denmark market with Danske Bank. These are the sorts of opportunities we see coming about, and therefore we see our focus into those areas will continue to give us benefits. Those are the questions I had and now I pass it on to Nilanjan. 	7945		2	 We are now looking at the future where there's a huge set of opportunities in the Middle East.

We are working with both generative AI platforms, large language models, which are open source, and we are working with generative AI with different companies have put forward.  Next question is from Mr.  Again, building on the previous point, our focus so far has been to make sure that we have a flexible approach for our employees.  Today, we are seeing more and more use cases and interest in that.  COVID provided a good opportunity to acquire.  And then we look at what is the method of running it day to day once the company has been acquired.  Krishnendu Chakraborty.  And we are fortunate that even in the consolidation area, we have a lot of opportunities that are coming in.  So, we are seeing that as really the way the future is evolving.  There are several clients who are requesting that the teams be working on campus for their projects and that is happening.	acquisitions invest undervalued rising uncertain statement acquisition experience spend said playing different now contribute growing comment expanding models fall here inc confidential sense money continue figures coming grown opportunities solutions saying unknown yes not positive expand history clearer complete answered underperformed concerned statements changed weakening interested enormous important great formed expanded today created deals focus changing good data growth right change progress investments announced acquired over behind attractive increase missing tomorrow there grow clear strong show products begin promising benefit comments started correct that used unclear one come	acquisitions participate been invest employees increasing undervalued website rising uncertain name statement acquisition improvements clients experience building encouraging orders new spend concerns said playing different value revenue working developing projects customers contribute growing comment expanding declined neutral fall negative here ticker remarks confidential sense money continue figures coming fail grown opportunities saying established unknown yes intact not changes positive history buying complete software answered underperformed happened work concerned statements changed reference sales weakening interested important today expanded formed mixed changing good follow advantages data growth right rise offices change progress investments struggled announced launched over behind decline attractive increase missing tomorrow there wrong grow clear strong stabilizing unchanged improving products problems announcements benefit comments active started responded correct announcement two below unclear one doing
1163	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Thanks, Salil.  	  The first question I have is, why are our margins dropping when most of our competition is doing fairly well? Is large deals eating the margins? What is the strategy to maintain good margin while having good growth? And this is a question from Jagirda Hanumesh Vasudeva Rao.  - 38 -   So, in FY 23, as you're aware, we had margin impacts from salary increases. We had some costs coming back like travel and our utilizations dipped. Also, large deals which were struck in prior years we had the initial impact of that. But as you know that our aspiration continues to be to give, you know, robust and strong growth, and robust and strong margins. So, we are working on the margin side continuing to look at levers like automation, looking at Pyramid optimization onsite-offshore mix. And from the growth side, as you are all aware, we have delivered industry-leading growth over the last few years. And we continue to aspire towards that.  The next question is how many MSME vendors were engaged during the financial year and what is the transaction value of business with such MSME vendors? Is there any delay in payment to such vendors in FY 22-23? If so, what is the value? This is a question from Mr. N. Nanchiappan.  As on March 31, 2023, the outstanding value of dues to MSMEs was ₹97 crore and the value of payment made after the due date along with interest thereon during the year was ₹33 crore.   The third question is how prepared is the company to hedge the risk of dollar depreciation?  As you all know that we have a very strong natural hedge in many markets which we operate. The revenue and the costs are matched. So, you have salaries in the local currency as well as the revenue. At what level of market risk is remaining, we hedge that through a very robust treasury policy which is governed by the Audit Committee. And you've seen the impact of that over the last few years which we have reduced the volatility of the Forex line tremendously due to this policy.  With that, I pass on to Manikantha.  A. G. S. Manikantha  Thank you, Nilanjan. I had a few questions from the web chat.  There were two shareholders who were asking of how to view the statutory registers. The questions were from Supriya and Pankaj Gupta.  The shareholders may note that all the information of the company is actually available on the website of the company. So, therefore, I request all the shareholders to look into the website of the company and also the Stock Exchange website for information dissemination and there are registers which are also filed with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. So, shareholders can actually take the information from those publicly available information. In spite of that, if there are any specific questions or information which is required, you can refer or you can send a query to investors@infosys.com and we will answer that suitably.   - 39 -  There was a next question from Sujata Kiran. The question is what is assurance from the company side against any allegation which may bring down the share price of the company such as insider trading and all that?  The answer is our robust policy framework always ensure compliance with applicable rules and regulations. We have also updated our compliance frameworks in response to the requirements of regulator and remain proactively engaged with them. Our robust Whistleblower Policy and program also ensures that any allegation is investigated in an objective manner. This framework serves to the interest of all the stakeholders.  Those were the questions which was directed at me. With that, I'll hand over to Mr. Chairman.  Nandan Nilekani  Thank you, Mani. And now we'll come to the second round of questions. These are the questions that were asked in the video conference, and we will answer them in the same order.  I had two questions. First question is our ratio of female directors is only 12% against 40% at employee level. Can we increase this please? This is shareholder Santosh.  Santosh, this AGM we have the resolution for Helene’s appointment placed before the shareholders for approval. Post that approval, if it is obtained, the ratio of female directors will go to 25%.  Second question – what is your view on AI replacing humans in the workforce?  We believe that AI has the potential to make a big improvement in the productivity of people. And we have found that the more qualified, the more experienced a person is, you can derive more benefit from AI like automatic code generation and all that. So definitely productivity will go up. But we believe that it will be used to amplify the productivity of existing people. Therefore, we feel that we'll be able to benefit from this much more. At the same time, we agree we have to become more efficient and share the efficiencies with our clients. So, we will take this, and Infosys is on the path to applying AI in a very rapid way with our AI-first strategy that we are rolling out across the company at the moment. Thank you. Now I'll hand over to Salil.  	5019		2	 Chairman.

1164	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Salil Parekh  	  Thanks, Nandan.  I have a few questions from the questions asked in the video and by some audio.  The first question from Mr. Sadananda Sastry, for me, what is the revenue by geography, India? India has the least place. How do we uplift this?   - 40 -   So, here we are doing some extremely strategic work to make India fully digital, as is being driven across the entire government. We are working on the GST program, on the Income tax program. And we will continue to work on such strategic programs as they become as the government is doing more of them. And we have really very strong expertise in those areas. So, this will continue to increase. We are also looking at the private sector where more and more of this digital work is starting to happen across the country.   Next question, also from Sadananda Sastry.  The question was about many senior employees leaving the company. How will the company take care of the image?  Here, we are extremely solid in terms of the strong bench of leaders that Infosys has. We feel that that group of leaders that Infosys has produced over the years through its own leadership development and through the work they do with clients in Delivery, in markets, really prepares them to do more and more work. And we have made sure that those leaders step up and take that on. We feel good about the fact that we have such a deep leadership bench, and we will continue to work on that as we go ahead.   Our next question from Abhirup – what are the company's plans on expanding the Cloud business?  Cloud is really absolutely core to what we are driving. We discussed earlier, the Cobalt platform, the capability set, whether it's on Infra-as-a-service, Software-as-a-service, Platform-as-a-service, we really have the leading market capability in Cloud. We see good traction for Cloud activity overall with clients. We see that there is a Cloud becomes the underpinning for transformation, as companies are looking to move into the digital age, into the AI age. That becomes the base foundation that will be needed. And with our strong partnerships with several of the large Cloud companies, we believe we are well- positioned to play in that and this will continue to grow.   Next question from Suman Agarwal. Question is how is the company going to grow in the next five years, organic versus inorganic?  Now, here, over the past several years, we made about eight or so acquisitions. Those acquisitions are well-integrated. We feel that approach will continue into the future. We will look for acquisitions which fit the strategic direction, the cultural fit and the value, the ability to integrate. Based on that, we will continue the acquisition approach and the organic approach will continue. We will continue to work with our clients to expand as they look for the cost and efficiency and automation programs in this environment and also look to expand on transformation programs as they continue to make changes in the business. So, both dimensions will carry on into the next few years.    - 41 -  Next question from Shailesh – Which are the verticals in the business which have been least affected and also significantly affected by the current macro-economic conditions?  So, here what we have shared in the past, we have seen industries such as Financial Services in mortgage and asset management, and investment banking, the Telecom sector, Hi-Tech, some areas of Retail, those are the ones that are most impacted within this environment that we have seen, what we reported in the end of Q4 and before that. We will see as we go ahead and how these evolve into the future quarters.   Next question from Celestine – How is the company managing employee attrition?   What we've seen over the last four quarters, Q4 and before, attrition has steadily been coming down each quarter on a quarterly basis. We see a lot of the initiatives that we've put in place, and also the overall economic environment, both of them relating to the attrition coming down, our employee engagement scores are continuing to go up and we believe that with that we will have a good control on attrition in the coming quarters. And we will make sure that that becomes translated as we look at the recruitment cycle and bringing in more employees from outside.   Our next question from Santosh – Can you please provide detail on how many new clients were added in the last financial year?  So here, in a specific point, in the last financial year, we have added 458 new clients.   Next question from Dharav – Apart from the Cloud capability and digital, does the company have other pillars on which it sees future growth?  So very clearly, the digital approach which comprises Cloud, digital, then also data and analytics, cybersecurity, IoT (Internet of Things), those are really good growth drivers. We are now seeing much more focus on generative AI that we have discussed quite a bit in all the questions and answers and overall becoming more AI-driven, AI-first and clients are looking at that. Then, in this environment, which is a different macro environment, there is more and more attention to cost efficiency, automation and consolidation. So, we are fortunate that we have both types of growth drivers where people are looking at transformation, they can look at Digital, Cloud and AI. And when they're looking at efficiency, they can look at cost, automation, consolidation and both engines are available with Infosys.   Our next question also from Dharav – Considering the FSI segment has small share in US regional banks, what do you expect impact on Infosys?   - 42 -  So, we have a diverse portfolio in Financial Services, large global banks, regional banks, mid-sector banks, in cards, in payments, investment banks, asset managers, really very broad and diversified client base in the FS business. Now within US, less than 2% of our revenue has this exposure into the regional banking, and there we are therefore comfortable that that exposure is not going to because it's less than 2% not going to impact us in an overall scale of the business.   Next question also from Dharav – What steps has company taken for wellbeing of employees?  So here, Infosys, over the years has been extremely focused on wellbeing of employees. We have internally programs, for example, on health assessment and lifestyle enrichment. We have wellness programs for physical wellbeing and social wellbeing. And we also have wellbeing rates, where across locations, we track it and support employees in driving that. We are seeing a good traction overall on employee wellbeing within the company today.   Next question from Redappa – A strong growth in digital with decline in core, how does the management have a plan to have growth both in digital and core?  What we saw last financial year in some quarters, we actually saw good growth in core and digital. And now in this environment, as we see more and more focus on cost efficiency, automation and consolidation, we will see more and more attention to core services. But keeping in mind the overall macro condition, we will balance and make sure our focus on digital transformation and on core services remain strong.   Next question from Shrenik Mehta – Please provide company strategy on both organic and inorganic.  So here, similar to the point we discussed earlier, we have an approach to both organic and inorganic. In acquisitions, we have a focus on what will fit strategically and culturally in terms of value and integration. And on organic growth, we have a lot of focus on the areas we've discussed on Cloud, on digital, on AI-first, and on cost and efficiency in this environment.   Next question from Shri Rama Vinodha – How is the company investing in employees for reskilling and upskilling?  So there, we've always had, over the last several years a strong focus on skilling. We have Mysore campus where we have in-person training for all of our new employees. Over the last few years, we put in place the Lex capability which allows online training through mobiles for all employees. We measure reskilling by each of our different departments to make sure that employees have the opportunity of reskilling, and then the projects that become available to employees to drive through that reskilling. We are tracking internally, something called a Digital Quotient, that allows us to measure what is the  - 43 -  change in the type of skills every employee has, and that allows them to then become more and more relevant for the new types of work our clients are doing.  Next question from Alex. What is the plan of the company in internally using AI for increasing productivity and quality?  So there, what we discussed on generative AI is applicable both with our clients, but also within the company, where we are leveraging large language models both on the open source and dedicated generative AI platforms to improve productivity in software development. We've already seen places where that improvement is visible within our teams. We're also taking our own software development modules and approaches, especially in our product business and putting them through the large language model to enhance productivity. And you will start to see the impact of this as we go through the next few quarters and years to make the benefit available internally to our productivity.   Those are the questions I had. With that, I'll pass it on to the Nilanjan.  	9451		2	 What we've seen over the last four quarters, Q4 and before, attrition has steadily been coming down each quarter on a quarterly basis.

1165	\infosys\june-23.pdf	Nilanjan Roy  	  Thank you, Salil.  The first question I have we have requested multiple times for the company to do buybacks using tender offer mode. SEBI has come up with new regulations that the buybacks need to be done through tender offer. Please confirm if further buybacks will be like that. And the shareholder name is Shamit Mehta.  So as you all know, we have a five-year capital allocation policy which we've laid out for the financial year 2024 period. And within that there are three components: there's a dividend component, a special dividend and a buyback component. And these allow predictability and consistency of returns. And as we've said, we've already returned 86% back and the Board looks at multiple elements looking at EPS accretion, looking at share price, yield on a cash return and then determines the most appropriate way to return this capital back. As regards the latest SEBI mandates on buybacks, we will continue to see that and how they will be implemented over the next year or two years.  The next question is from Sadananda Sastry on page 301, Other expenses ₹133 crore increase in ECL. How do we reduce it?  So, as you know, the company makes provisions for expected credit losses based on historical performance on the macro-economic conditions in terms of the geographies we operate in, and the sectors we operate in, and therefore makes the provisions appropriately. This is as per the relevant accounting standards.   - 44 -  Does the company have plans of doing CSR activities in the eastern part of the country? This is from shareholder Manoj Kumar.  So, as you know, our CSR policy encompasses work around women empowerment, around health, education, and of course, sustainability, targeting the underprivileged. We also look at criteria around scaling up of these projects, and making sure that they have an impact and follow our overall themes. We have also started doing many projects in the east of the country, and if they meet these criteria, we will continue to expand there.  The next question is regarding work from office two days from office two days from home, what is the policy of the company in this regard?  I think we have a very flexible policy and a hybrid policy in terms of working from office and working from home to give people the flexibility. We encourage, of course, people to come to work a few days, and we believe that increases our social capital. And I think a big portion of this, of course depends upon our client requirements and our clients of course insist that employees come into work. So, this helps us maintaining a fair balance of giving client connectivity, and time for teams working together.   Infosys margins may remain subdued in the next two, three years. What are the levers available to improve this?  Reddappa.  So as you know, we've given guidance for financial year 2024. And of course, we don't give a guidance beyond that. But like I explained earlier in one question, we have multiple levers for us to aspire to get higher margins and robust margins. We've talked about the Pyramid. We've talked about onsite offshore mix. Automation remains a big element, pricing, and there are the levers like subcon, etc., which help us to continue to look at improving margins.   Next question is whether the company is listed on any global ESG forum or platform. And this is from	3356		1	 So, as you know, the company makes provisions for expected credit losses based on historical performance on the macro-economic conditions in terms of the geographies we operate in, and the sectors we operate in, and therefore makes the provisions appropriately.

1174	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Rishi. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining us for this session. I trust you and your families are well and safe. We had an exceptional year and an exceptional quarter. Our YoY constant currency growth was at 9.6% for Q4 and for the full year our growth was 5% in constant currency. Our digital business grew by 34% YoY in Q4 and now representing 51.5% of our overall revenue. Our large deal wins were at $14 bn for the full year, a growth of 57% over the previous financial year and they were at $2.1 bn for Q4. Within the full year large deals, 66% were net new helping us to set up a very strong foundation for the next financial year. With these exceptional results, we had industry-leading growth in FY21. We continue to gain market share and I am grateful for the trust our clients have put in Infosys as we partner with them for their digital transformation programs. Our growth was broad based, with several of our industry segments showing strong growth YoY and it stems from a market-leading capabilities, digital, cloud, cybersecurity and in data analytics which allow us now to work with our clients’ most aspirational digital transformation activities. Our operating margin for FY21 improved by 320-basis points to reach 24.5% for the full year. For the quarter as well it was 24.5%. I am extremely proud of our employees and their enormous commitment especially during this past year but in general across the years. We will launch our second compensation review in a phased manner starting in July 2021. Our employees and our entire leadership team worked cohesively and for the benefit of our clients. This approach which   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 4 we call One Infosys has really enabled us to have a very strong FY21 and allowed us to look ahead with success. Now looking ahead we see continued strong demand from our clients, especially in digital, in cloud, in data and we have a strong foundation of large deals. With that our constant currency full year revenue guidance for FY22 is growth between 12% and 14%. For operating margin, our superior performance in FY21 was in part because of the improvement in several strategic cost levers and in part because of cost avoidance and deferment. With normalcy returning gradually across the world, we anticipate some of those costs to return. With that our operating margin guidance for FY22 is between 22% and 24%. In keeping with our capital allocation policy, we propose an increase to the total dividend per share by 54% over the previous year for a full year dividend at Rs.27. In addition, we propose a buyback of equity shares of up to Rs. 9200 Crores, which is approximately $1.2 bn. We will use the open market method for this buyback. Thank you very much. With that let me pause and let us open it up for questions.	2840		2	 Our YoY constant currency growth was at 9. 6% for Q4 and for the full year our growth was 5% in constant currency. 1 bn for Q4.  Our large deal wins were at $14 bn for the full year, a growth of 57% over the previous financial year and they were at $2.  Our growth was broad based, with several of our industry segments showing strong growth YoY and it stems from a market-leading capabilities, digital, cloud, cybersecurity and in data analytics which allow us now to work with our clients’ most aspirational digital transformation activities.  In addition, we propose a buyback of equity shares of up to Rs.  I am extremely proud of our employees and their enormous commitment especially during this past year but in general across the years.

This is something that we had anticipated and it is a reflection of the strong demand that we are seeing in the market. Having said that, we are increasing our efforts to retain our talent. We had the first round of compensation increase effective January. We have announced one more round of normal cycle with effective date July and in between any other interventions that are required to retain some of the best talent, we will continue to do that. Over the past year also we have engaged our people, we provided a strong value proposition in terms of engagement and enablement. There is a lot of focus on continuous learning, lot of important projects that people get to work on, there is a lot of career advancement opportunity and so on. In the past year also during COVID, we have really done extremely well in terms of engaging with people, engaging their families, providing a lot of support. We had more than 900 plus interventions and so on and we have received very positive feedback. So, we are very confident that with these measures we should be able to navigate through this. The attritions are likely to remain at this level for the next one or two quarters given the demand, but we are very confident of managing through this and meeting our client commitments.	1388		2	 In the past year also during COVID, we have really done extremely well in terms of engaging with people, engaging their families, providing a lot of support.

My first question is to Pravin with respect to the guidance which has been given especially the margins part of it. You entered the year 24.5% operating margins, and your guidance is in the range of 22% to 24%. What is the kind of headwind that you are seeing in terms of guidance or in terms of margin that you have been conservative in giving guidance. I mean, your upper end is also not matching the full-year guidance, which you did for this financial year. Second one is with respect to the deal wins $2.1 bn in Q4 but it seems that your run rate has slowed down towards the end of Q4, is it because some of the deals have been pushed to the next financial year and if you can give some color on the financial services business segment as a whole as well?

1181	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 I will start with the large deals and financial services and then I will pass it onto Nilanjan or Salil to respond on the margin guidance. On the large deals, we had a 23 large deal wins this quarter at $2.1 bn and for the year is $14.1 bn which is a record in Infosys’ history; and even for the Q4 52% of large deal wins was net new and for the year it is 66% and in fact the net new for the year $9.4 bn is higher than all the large deal TCV that we did in whole of FY20. Obviously, this large deal, there is some volatility in terms of large deal wins, many of the deals take three to six months for closure. There are times when we are able to close many deals in the given quarter. There are times when it gets pushed up but given that we have about $14 bn with 66% net new, we have a very strong foundation getting into the next year FY22. So, we are comfortable with where we are. In terms of Financial Services, we had record growth, industry leading growth in the past few quarters that continues in this quarter as well. For the year, we had 25 large deal wins in this space and in this quarter itself 6 of the wins were in Financial Services. So we are well positioned for this sector to continue this strong performance in FY22 as well. In terms of demand areas, we are seeing of course a lot of transformational programs around mortgage transformation, lending services, front to back digitization, customer experience, modernization, call center technologies and operations, transformation and so on. So we are optimistic about this segment.	1556		2	1 bn which is a record in Infosys’ history; and even for the Q4 52% of large deal wins was net new and for the year it is 66% and in fact the net new for the year $9.

1182	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 If you see our margins you have to go back to FY20 and we ended FY20 with 21.3% margin and we have ended FY21 with 24.5% so that is a 3.2% margin growth and that kind of growth we have not seen  in the recent past. Like we have told you, over the last few quarters as well that the margin improvement of 320-basis points has come about with two or three reasons, one has been the cost deferments that Salil mentioned because last year of course, we delayed the entire pay cycle, number one. We also had cut back on our promotion cycles. In addition, we have turned aggressive cost-cutting, and things like travel had naturally stopped, on marketing etc., and we also did a lot of work on our strategic cost levers around pyramid and onsite and offshore automation. All these three helped us during the year to come to the 24.5%. These cost tailwinds which was about the deferral costs would come back in the FY22. So, the first pay hike which was in January has been announced that is making a headwind and as Salil just mentioned we are also looking at the second payment from 1st July. As the year progresses in the second half and as vaccine starts rolling out, things like travel etc., will open and some of these costs at the tail end will come up. So, we think 22% to 24% is a comfortable rate. It is important to keep in mind as well that the pre-pandemic events in FY20, our guidance was 21% to 23%. So now in that sense we are now 1% higher in terms of 22% to 24% so we remain quite comfortable with that.

1185	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Let me start with the digital one and then come to geography and Pravin can add something on geography as well. On digital, we are seeing tremendous growth, we have 34% growth in this Q4 and we see all of our clients are at different stages of their digital transformation activities. What is good for us is clients are trusting Infosys to work with them in many different parts of the digital transformation, for example in cloud, data and analytics, cybersecurity and many other areas. Given the trajectory of growth we have seen recently and given the demand and pipeline we believe this sort of growth will continue, we do not have a specific number for the end of the year percentage that digital will be but we feel comfortable that we are gaining market share and growing quite fast in digital. In terms of geography, the demand in US clients, European clients are strong. What we are seeing is with the vaccine rollouts, the US has already started to see some resumption of normalcy over the next 3 to 4 months and Europe also has progressed quite a lot and they will come maybe just a little bit after that. UK is also in good shape from that perspective with their lockdown starting to ease as we saw yesterday and we think that that will also come into good shape with all of the stimulus that each of those governments have provided, something similar for us in Asia Pacific business, especially as it relates to Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. So overall the demand environment is starting to improve in most of these places.	1545		2	 UK is also in good shape from that perspective with their lockdown starting to ease as we saw yesterday and we think that that will also come into good shape with all of the stimulus that each of those governments have provided, something similar for us in Asia Pacific business, especially as it relates to Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.

Salil, I want to first ask you about the factors that you have considered for the FY22 guidance, which sectors is it going to come from? Are you looking at new areas. We had TCS say yesterday that they are looking at disrupting the consulting business. Are you looking at increasing your addressable market as well? Any new areas that you could look at and on deal wins, could you explain why there was a sharp decline in the deal wins from the last quarter? Is this the run rate that we can expect going forward in the coming quarters as well? Pravin, of course, there has been a sharp spike in attrition, you talked about the fact that because of this demand, but we did see that TCS has reported an all-time low attrition for the quarter, so what can Infosys do differently and in FY22 what are the wage hike that we can expect, are you going to be hiring more, what are the hiring plans for FY22? And Nilanjan are you factoring wage hikes and more hiring in the margin pressure as well?	1052		1	 Pravin, of course, there has been a sharp spike in attrition, you talked about the fact that because of this demand, but we did see that TCS has reported an all-time low attrition for the quarter, so what can Infosys do differently and in FY22 what are the wage hike that we can expect, are you going to be hiring more, what are the hiring plans for FY22.

1188	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh  	 Let me start with the guidance on revenue. I think 12% to 14% growth is an extremely strong guidance and indication that we see very good demand and we also see that this is coming across a strong foundation from what was achieved in the previous financial year. The demand is coming in a broad based way. We are seeing almost all of our industries  providing good outlook for demand. So it is not in any one space or the other and the disruption question that you asked, our focus is really on the digital transformation that our clients are driving and one of the biggest components of that is cloud. As you will recall, we launched our Infosys Cobalt cloud capability last year and that is one of the strongest areas that are tracking with the clients for the growth and of course there are other components of digital which looks at experience, which relates to how our clients are looking to use the technology in digital and then data and analytics and cybersecurity. So those are the areas that we are seeing and with the level of confidence we have, we are saying the growth guidance will be 12% to 14%. In terms of what we have seen on the deal wins, as Pravin was sharing, large deal wins are typically somewhat volatile in a given quarter, but for a given year they are quite a good indicator. This last financial year, we had $14 bn of large deal wins. The previous financial year we had $9 bn. So it is a huge step up on an annual basis and we see the demand in this financial year to be quite strong and we will continue to do well with large deal wins. With that let me pass it on to Pravin.	1607		2	Let me start with the guidance on revenue.

It is similar to what we saw about   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 9 four quarters back. Obviously it is higher than what we saw in the previous quarter. As mentioned earlier, there are many interventions that we are doing to retain the best of our employees. We have a very compelling value proposition and with compensation interventions, with promotions and with many other initiatives that we have in place we are very confident to sustain around this level going forward and without compromising on any client requirements.

Salil, my question to you is, if I am looking at the kind of estimates that most of the analysts are working with, especially in terms of buyback, the buyback expectation was 11,000 to 15,000 odd Crores which is on an average 12,000 Crores of sales, expectation and you have announced a buyback of 9,200 Crores so what is the expectations from an analyst perspective? Any reasons for the same and can you give some colour on the same? I also want to understand what is the progress in terms of Daimler deal by the revenue growth as well as the margins guidance is fairly in line with expectations. I wanted to understand how the Daimler deal would start contributing to the revenue as well as in terms of profitability and if we could also get more colour in terms of the margin trajectory. We would see some of the costs returning, so how would those costs shape up and impact the margin trajectory?	941		1	Salil, my question to you is, if I am looking at the kind of estimates that most of the analysts are working with, especially in terms of buyback, the buyback expectation was 11,000 to 15,000 odd Crores which is on an average 12,000 Crores of sales, expectation and you have announced a buyback of 9,200 Crores so what is the expectations from an analyst perspective.

1192	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks. Let me start with the buyback. Nilanjan might have some point to add to that and then Pravin will take Daimler question and Nilanjan for the margin. On the buyback, our approach has been to work with our capital return policy and our capital return policy has been quite clearly   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 10 stated a couple of years ago, that we plan to return 85% cash back to shareholders and there are two components to this. One which relates to the dividends, one which relates to possible buyback. So, keeping all those factors in mind, the board decided that this was the amount that made sense. We have a clear view in terms of how this will support the capital return policy across the 5 year period and how we are able to return 85% which is our target amount. That really is the rationale for the 9,200 Crores that we have announced as a buyback. Let me pass it to Nilanjan first if there is anything else on the buyback and then Pravin.	974		1	 On the buyback, our approach has been to work with our capital return policy and our capital return policy has been quite clearly   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 10 stated a couple of years ago, that we plan to return 85% cash back to shareholders and there are two components to this.

Our cumulative payout for FY21 and FY20 which are the first 2 years of the capital allocation policy, we would have paid out 83% of the 85%, so in that sense I think this is completely in line with our policy and that is what the board also considered when deciding the amount of buyback. So, I think it is quite transparent and actually working in line with clearly articulated forward looking policy as well. So that is on the buyback. On the margins, like I said and we have been talking about it during the last year that our margin has increased and some of them have come from the deferment of costs and the cost deferrals and we are cognizant of that and have been calling that out that these will become headwinds during FY22 and we have factored that into our 22% to 24% guidance. But having said that, this would still be a 100 basis points above our pre-COVID guidance which was last at 21% to 23%. So in that sense, this is a step up in our underlying margin trajectory.	1158		2	 On the margins, like I said and we have been talking about it during the last year that our margin has increased and some of them have come from the deferment of costs and the cost deferrals and we are cognizant of that and have been calling that out that these will become headwinds during FY22 and we have factored that into our 22% to 24% guidance.

1196	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Shilpa Phadnis 	 Good evening gentlemen. Sir, you have set yourself a three year roadmap to turn around Infosys. What is Infosys’ next, especially from a strategic standpoint when the pandemic has gone from threat to opportunities to spurt your client’s transformation agenda? The second question is though cloud adoption is driving a multiyear tech cycle, with the ramp up in cloud deals, how do you see the pricing, will it only get better? Coming from the recent ISG commentary, they talk about how the cloud ACV’s are moderating, so what are the specific challenges in terms of acceleration in cloud migrations? My third question is on the deal front, you have won a $14 bn TCV but largely is it on renewals restructuring, is there a challenge in terms of the new scope trajectory, if you can help us with this, sir. Thank you.	815		1	Sir, you have set yourself a three year roadmap to turn around Infosys.

1197	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil S Parekh 	 Thanks for the questions. I will start off with the first one on our three-year program and how we look ahead. We think we had an extremely successful three-year journey, some of the elements are how we really reshaped and become a digital services company. Today, digital is more than 50% of our business. The large deals that you mentioned at $14 bn, but there is also a tremendous amount of work we have done in reskilling of our employees, in looking at automation, and variety of steps within the company, the way we transformed to a live enterprise, are a complete change in the way Infosys is working with clients and working with employees today. Now as we look ahead what we see is real intense capabilities around digital and there the main focus remains around cloud, around data and analytics, around cybersecurity and with the launch of Cobalt, Infosys Cobalt Cloud capability set, we are again in a leading position to work with clients on their cloud journeys. So, we feel quite comfortable in the path we have taken and how we are looking ahead in partnering with our clients on their digital transformation journeys. On the large deals, Pravin will elaborate but the one point I wanted to make was with the $14 bn numbers that you referenced, 66% is net new. So, in many ways that is the driver. Of course we are also very strong in doing what is going on and those are the factors that come into play as we look at the guidance for the future. Let me pass it on to Pravin.	1491		2	 Of course we are also very strong in doing what is going on and those are the factors that come into play as we look at the guidance for the future.

1198	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 I think as Salil said overall $14 bn, 66% is net new and even in Q4, 52% was net new. Last year when we did $9 bn of large deals TCV, only about 37% was net new. So, this varies, there is some volatility in net new but it is equally important. We have to win renewals; we cannot afford to lose whatever we have at present. At the same time, we also have to capture market share and that is   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 12 where the net new comes in. So, we have a good balance out there and I think this year given the 66% of what we have won is net new, it is a very strong base for getting into FY22.	617		2	I think as Salil said overall $14 bn, 66% is net new and even in Q4, 52% was net new.

There is a piece which is of migration, but there is a piece which relates to how clients are adopting public cloud or private cloud and there is a piece within our Cobalt structure which relates to how clients are looking at SaaS providers and rolling out that capability within their ecosystem. Our experience is that actually cloud programs are quite large and today what we have seen in FY21 within $14 bn is a very strong cloud capability programs that we are working with clients on, so we do not see that scale or size of cloud deals is going to decelerate. In terms of margins, there are different profiles or different things of the cloud depending on whether you are working on the public cloud or working on SaaS. In general, we do have a view on our digital margin which is on average higher than the average margin of the business.	1044		1	 Our experience is that actually cloud programs are quite large and today what we have seen in FY21 within $14 bn is a very strong cloud capability programs that we are working with clients on, so we do not see that scale or size of cloud deals is going to decelerate.

1203	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil S. Parekh 	 Thanks for the questions, Ayushman. First one relating to work-from-home, what we have been clear and I think Pravin shared this during our past earnings calls as well, is to say that first we have a very strong work-from-home approach that is working well. Thanks to the infrastructure that we built up within the company and the rapid speed at which we moved our people to work-from- home. What we have now learnt as you have seen Nilanjan shared his stats, onsite mix has moved significantly to offshore in the last financial year, much more rapidly than it had done in the previous several years. We feel that some of this is the way clients are looking at the business; however, there is also a lot of use and work that we do in our digital centres in Europe, in US, in Australia and Singapore and those type of work will continue even if that becomes a hybrid model, which means partially working from home, partially working from a work location. Having said all of that, we still think that there will be a need to build up some social capital and some of that will be built when people start to come back to the office. So, there are two things at play here, the hybrid model and the shift on the onsite offshore mix and there are different ways we feel those will play out and we will see how that looks in the next few quarters or maybe the next few years. On M&A, we continue with our focus on Digital and Cloud acquisition opportunities. We will continue to look with the cultural fit, the strategic fit and the cost price of the asset that we are looking to acquire. With all those things coming into play, we hope to continue with our M&A activity in this year as well.	1685		2	 We feel that some of this is the way clients are looking at the business; however, there is also a lot of use and work that we do in our digital centres in Europe, in US, in Australia and Singapore and those type of work will continue even if that becomes a hybrid model, which means partially working from home, partially working from a work location.

We believe that is going extremely well. As Pravin was sharing some of the points on attrition and what we are doing in terms of real strong employee engagement. There are two factors I also want to highlight. We are making sure that we have huge levels of recruitment both from college campuses in India and outside India and also laterally. The main reason we are seeing a lot of this focus on Infosys employees is also because our training is probably the best training in the industry, and we are extremely proud of that training. We believe that that is the training that drives what we want to do in terms of digital programs with our clients and that is where we are making sure that all of the effort is put in and how we are fulfilling all over the world for our clients. For the other question, let me just check if Nilanjan would you want to address that, please.	998		2	Let me start on the question you had about roles on client projects.

So if you see that secular trend line has largely been flat, but of course we continue to drive initiatives like digital pricing and we know that our digital side of the business is giving us higher margins and higher RPP but at the same time there is some downward pressure on the core side of the business which offsets that but our intent continues to remain to command large and larger premium for our digital side, but secular trends have been largely flat as of now as a combined portfolio.	800		0	On the revenue per employee if you go back in the industry, it has largely been flat and it is a reflection of two things, that is client pricing so which is a downward pressure and the other hand you start putting in automation which tries to negate some of that client discounts and rate negotiation.

Salil, I know you addressed the consulting question at the beginning, but my question is the way different companies are approaching it seems to be very different. While some of them are taking the acquisition route, others are talking about the organic route in terms of how they will leverage expertise of both the company as well as the client to kind of build out an end-to-end solution. Now Infosys has tried acquisitions in the past, so what would your own approach be to sort of upsell IT services. Is this an area that you are looking at seriously? Do you think Infosys can do what a McKinsey or an Accenture are doing today in this area? The other question was for Nilanjan, while a lot of people are talking about the buyback premium, they are talking about gap up opening for the stock tomorrow, 25%, I think is higher than more people were expecting, so what did you factor in while deciding on the buyback price. Pravin, couple of questions for you, you said that you will look at a number of incentives, would expanding the ESOP pool be one of them, because you are also competing with Tata’s and Hyperscalers to acquire talent and why did you put off this second compensation review till July. I mean, shouldn’t you not to have done this perhaps now or next month considering your attrition is at 15%, your utilization is at 88%, so what would your comfort level be on utilization also going forward? Thank you.	1475		1	Salil, I know you addressed the consulting question at the beginning, but my question is the way different companies are approaching it seems to be very different.

1212	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your question. Let me start with the first one. I think what we are seeing in the market is with all the digital work there is more decision making, that is, in addition to the technology buyers, also the business buyers. What Infosys has done over the years is built a very strong consulting business. As you pointed out through acquisitions but also through organic means, you know over the last couple of years, our consulting business is performing well and connecting well with clients across different geographies and industries. So, our approach is very much of the view where we need to work with business buyers and make sure that our consulting and technology teams work hand in hand. If you look at some of the large digital transformation programs we had started in the   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 16 last year, we take an example of Vanguard, that really is something that looks at business issues and insights which are driven by our consulting team and also industry leads which are driven by our industry team and technology and process operation’s capabilities those coming from the tech and BPM. It is really bringing all of these things together, that is more important in our mind, the ‘One Infosys’ approach that I referenced at the opening as opposed to just doing one thing let’s say consulting or on another thing which is the industry or something else on tech . So yes, we see many peers that you referenced, doing those sort of things but we are now well ahead of that. We are in this more where all of this is integrated, as ‘one Infosys’ and bring that to the client. Let me pass it to Pravin, with respect to the second question.	1686		2	I think what we are seeing in the market is with all the digital work there is more decision making, that is, in addition to the technology buyers, also the business buyers.

1213	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 On the attrition front, obviously, we had a salary increase effective January 1 and so we felt July 1, would be the right thing. Historically, also we have always had a phased approach to compensation increase and we do it in a staggered manner. And that is something we want to get back to our regular cycle in the coming year as well and so we felt July would be adequate. In the interim, as I said earlier, if there are any other interventions required in terms of retentions, we will be happy to do that and we are already doing that. In terms of RSUs, already for 10% to 15% of our promising people in the mid-level and it is not something new, in the past few years we have been issuing RSUs and that program continues.	726		2	 In terms of RSUs, already for 10% to 15% of our promising people in the mid-level and it is not something new, in the past few years we have been issuing RSUs and that program continues.

1214	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 On the buyback price, first thing is this is an open market buyback unlike the other buyback which you have seen in the recent past which are tender buybacks where the price is fixed. So, our premium of 25% give or take versus 1400 is the maximum buyback price that is number one. So, it is not the price which we will buy that is the maximum price, this is the more longer drawn process in terms of timing, because firstly this needs shareholder approval at the AGM which is scheduled for June and then there is a longer process during which we will buy. So, this we will go on for the next six to seven months if not more and considering both these factors, we think a maximum price of 1750 is quite fair.	708		1	 So, it is not the price which we will buy that is the maximum price, this is the more longer drawn process in terms of timing, because firstly this needs shareholder approval at the AGM which is scheduled for June and then there is a longer process during which we will buy.

Also please give us color on the core business aspect which has been going down, where do we see that bottoming out.	increase underperformed there changed clear stabilizing here broken show continue good follow saying said comments correct yes progress comment down unclear positive declined over	behind complete spoken increase answered underperformed happened there statements changed done clear invest here grow ticker remarks removed show gone nothing sense money name statement say continue good saying said comments right correct yes progress struggled comment down not unclear positive history over
1217	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for those questions. Let me start Shivani. What we have done over the three years we talked a little bit earlier about I think a huge way both within the company and how we connect with clients on their digital journeys and there has been a huge change there. Now looking ahead as you said on a five-year horizon, I think, the thing really to keep in mind is one of the biggest opportunities in front of us because our clients are going there is really the cloud opportunity and it may be simple to say cloud because it encapsulates a variety of things that is part of the reason why we have launched Cobalt. It really goes into a lot of specific elements which relate to different parts of the cloud - whether it is the public cloud, private cloud, of course in the hybrid environment or the SaaS capabilities and then migrations and cloud native development. These elements, each of them are huge capabilities that we have built up and we think that this is going to be significant part of where, our clients are driving their digital journeys and so we think this should become bigger part of our work going forward. Another area I would really focus on is data and analytics. It is something that is becoming more critical in how that is being developed with our clients in mind and it is an integral part of what we are doing in our digital transformation work with our clients, so that will become large. There are couple of other places where we are also making huge inroads which we will talk more and more about as we go ahead into the next five years, but we are well positioned to capture what our clients are looking to drive in their spend and therefore become closer partners with them. With that, let me pass it may be first Nilanjan on capex, then Pravin with the salary discussion.

Going into next year, some of the in-flight projects we think will start back and we will continue to focus on enablement of work-from- home. So, there will be some ramp up of capex versus the prior but it will still be below the pre- pandemic levels.	494		0	 Going into next year, some of the in-flight projects we think will start back and we will continue to focus on enablement of work-from- home.

Whenever you give an update guidance you say that there is a good demand coming in from the clients and that is one statement that we have heard across the quarters and it is true because amidst the pandemic such is the demand for digitization. But I was wondering if you could go a little bit granular on that and give me some color in terms of, what is it that the clients are exactly demanding because again we have also heard you say that you want to be a partner in the digital transformation of clients, so could you give us a little more color on that please? And I heard Pravin say that we are going to hire 25,000  freshers from India and overseas, I wanted to you ask about the change in the US administration and if that is going to have any effect on the visa, the whole working environment for software service exporters like yourself? Just those two.

1222	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for the question. I think to give you some color on the sort of demand we are seeing. Today if you look, we have work which we are doing, for example in the retail sector where we are working with clients who are changing what they are doing, with how their end customer - the   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 19 consumer is connecting with them through different channels for buying products, for connecting with and giving feedback on what is going on. Their sales teams are using different channels to connect with different rep structures. All of this is being built on a cloud ecosystem and it is also being built with a new set of technology which requires leverage, whether it is all of our capabilities on cloud. For example, in many cases, we are using unique and agile ways to build new software, using the experience capabilities of our digital studios, design the way this technology works or even roll it out across the cloud into usage worldwide at the same time. So that is one example of the type of project, these are different depending on industry whether you look at insurance business, the utilities business, the consumer products business or the banking business. In each of those areas, there are new ways that our clients are looking to connect with their customers to grow their business and that makes it more and more critical for them to drive these projects faster because by doing that they are able to impact their own growth, their own market share which is where our support comes. So, all of that will translate to good demand and a good demand is translating for us to a very strong revenue guidance of 12% to 14%.	1668		1	 So, all of that will translate to good demand and a good demand is translating for us to a very strong revenue guidance of 12% to 14%.

1223	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 On the visa front, obviously, our strategy is to be less dependent on visa, and this is something that we have been embarking on for the past two to three years. Today, more than 69% of our US workforce are locals and so to that extent we are less and less dependent on the visa regime. Having said that the early indications are, Biden administration seems to be much more business friendly, much more immigration friendly, we have seen many of the restriction, with respect to Trump administration have either been deferred or they have allowed it to lapse.  One of these amendments around compensation increases, has also been put off by more than a year. So, it is early days we had remained busy, but from an Infosys perspective we are less and less dependent on the visas, we are a truly robust model with lot of focus on localization.	842		0	On the visa front, obviously, our strategy is to be less dependent on visa, and this is something that we have been embarking on for the past two to three years.

Salil, you talked this evening about acceleration towards offshore, in your onshore, offshore hybrid model and you also talked about digital design studios, acceleration of cloud, all of it can be served from your offshore centers. I just wanted to know what is going to happen to your localization plan, what is going to happen to the development centers that you were going to set up in the US especially in Europe, how does the   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 20 plan change? My second question is about the coming challenges, you talked today about having 25,000 people from the campuses in the coming year, maybe 26000 if my math is right to what Pravin just said, so there is going to be a  lot of demand not just for fresh graduates of which India produces millions, but also in the middle and top levels of talent, I wonder if that is going to be a constraint for growth and if you see any challenges facing the industry, if you could elaborate on this please?	1035		1	Salil, you talked this evening about acceleration towards offshore, in your onshore, offshore hybrid model and you also talked about digital design studios, acceleration of cloud, all of it can be served from your offshore centers.

1226	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your questions Saritha. First one on what we see as the mix, we were starting to see in the last financial year, was a big shift on the offshore side with the onsite mix coming down. Having said that we still have a huge amount of work that we do from our digital centers, our design studios, our proximity centers whereas in Europe, US, North America and Canada or in Asia Pacific, in Australia and so on. So those are the things, which are very much a part of what is going on with our clients, some of that discussion was on if the hybrid model becomes part of our future, but even those centers – those digital studios, those digital delivery centers will have the hybrid model working, but in those geographies. So two trends are working here, which we see, one is that there is some shift to offshore that we saw in the last year in terms of delivery and we have shared some of the stats on how the onsite mix has evolved and the second one is much more hybrid wherever the work is going on, hybrid in that sense work-from-home, whether it is going on in the European market, in the US market or in the Asia Pacific market or ofcourse when they are doing that in India whether it is in campus or work-from-home. Our sense is both of those trends will play out and we will see how those trends play out. So, all of the work we have done in terms of building local delivery centres will help us, but also the fact that we have built our capability that can allow our employees to work in this hybrid mode, work-from-home and work- from-office will also help us as we move ahead. In terms of recruitment, as Pravin was sharing, we are looking at in the range of 26000 campus hires, couple of thousand which would be outside India, about 24000 which will be in India. As you pointed out we have within India, a large number of college graduates that we can look at for recruitment, but there is also  lateral recruitment that we will continue to do. In terms of what the constraints could be, we feel that the demand environment is extremely strong, we believe that we have the ability through recruitment, training to fulfill that demand. So today from our perspective, we see quite an optimistic view of where the market is, where the clients are and not really so many constraints.	2298		1	 Our sense is both of those trends will play out and we will see how those trends play out.

1229	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 First, I think on the revenue we are extremely proud and delighted with the trust of the clients because we have as you pointed out 5% growth in this extremely difficult financial year that just completed and we see that really because the way we have built the capabilities of digital,  the way our clients have given us many of those projects we talked at the start of the year for some consolidation, we have seen that in this last financial year and there has also been extreme focus on automation and cost capabilities and there again we believe we have a leading capability in terms of automation that our clients have really engaged with us. So, we see that gain of market share differentiate and position Infosys as the industry leading growth company, in terms of this IT services business worldwide. Now the way we see, what we are seeing on large deals, we see a good traction. The large deals really come when clients are looking at very strategic, digital transformation programs, which start with business, technology, and operations together or look at business, technology and cloud, which drives a lot of that change. We have also shared that in general our digital margins on  average are higher than the company average margins. We are not specifically looking at large deal margins that we share externally, but our margin guidance is extremely robust between 22% and 24% and we feel comfortable with the way the large deals that we have worked on, that we will deliver to that guidance in the coming year.	1527		2	 We are not specifically looking at large deal margins that we share externally, but our margin guidance is extremely robust between 22% and 24% and we feel comfortable with the way the large deals that we have worked on, that we will deliver to that guidance in the coming year.

Could you actually give us a colour on the deal size you are getting, the size of the deals you have won till now and where and when do you see the smaller deals receding? And one question for you Pravin Sir, in   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 22 the same time last year we saw a lot of sectors like retail, manufacturing and travel getting affected because of the pandemic and right now globally I think at least in India we are back to square one in terms of the pandemic, so could you give us some colour on these sectors which are directly affected by the pandemic. What is your outlook on the sectors?

First one, we are seeing demand both for large deals and for midsized deals, so we do not see that there is less demand for one or the other. Overall, we see good demand across all that spectrum. Pravin mentioned the composition of our large deals, the number of large deals that we have and it is spread across different size, buckets even in those large deals. What we have seen today, really is based on the capabilities that we have built up we see good traction for small, medium, and large deals from our client base and that is helping us to see a strong outlook for growth for the next year. Let me pass it to Pravin for the other one.	672		2	First one, we are seeing demand both for large deals and for midsized deals, so we do not see that there is less demand for one or the other.

1232	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 In terms of some of the distressed sectors like retail or manufacturing, let me take retail for starters. Obviously, retail was one of the sectors which was majorly impacted by the pandemic, many of the subsegments of retail continue to be impacted. However, from our perspective barring the first quarter of last year, in the last three quarters we have seen gradual uptick in demand from retail segment. We had in fact we have ended Q4 with good performance in retail, so on the back of this increasing performance as well as some of the net new large deal wins, we had in the second half of last year, we feel fairly positive about retail in the coming year. Likewise, in manufacturing this was again one of the sectors which was majorly impacted. They had challenges both on the supply side constraints as well as on the demand side but with the economy opening, we have slowly started seeing some uptick in demand, in industrial to some extent in auto space. Aerospace we still see softness and it may take several quarters for it to recover, but again in this space we have done extremely well. In fact, one of the largest deal,  last quarter we won one of the largest deals in the history of Infosys, so we have industry leading performance in this segment, and we remain optimistic in the coming year as well in terms of growth and increasing market share. Travel and hospitality again continue to be dealing with multiple waves and so on. So here again, while many sectors are distressed there is a need for them to invest in technology to build resilience and to increase their connect with consumers and employees in the virtual world. So, while the distress comes on one hand, there seems to be continued investment on technology on the other hand. That is something we have started seeing in the travel and hospitality as well,   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 23 though in a small sense, not as big as what we are seeing in some of the other sectors like financial services.	1999		2	 So here again, while many sectors are distressed there is a need for them to invest in technology to build resilience and to increase their connect with consumers and employees in the virtual world.

For Pravin, what is the percentage of salary hikes that were offered across bands or levels of employees, were there particular concentrations in any geographies or type of delivery units and how many employees have been hired in 2021 so far and how much of these were freshers.	behind acquisitions complete participate increase neutral answered there grow changed clear invest here ticker remarks removed release pay confidential questions reported statement today figures spend orders opportunities good said comments unknown right correct yes progress contribute below comment changes unclear positive history over	behind acquisitions complete given there statements changed clear invest grow here ticker remarks removed pay show unchanged confidential limited questions statement formed asked figures spend opportunities good said comments unknown right responded correct yes progress contribute comment not changes unclear positive history over
1237	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 I will start first with the salary hike. We did one salary hike effective January. The quantum was similar to what we have done historically, and the quantum of salary hike also varies from geographies. It is different in India, it is different in other geographies and even within these geographies, we normally tend to have higher compensation increase at lower levels and lower compensation increase at higher levels. So that is something we had really done in the January cycle. Now in terms of number of hires, this year we hired about 36,500 people, out of it about 21000 people are freshers and I am talking about FY21.	627		1	 The quantum was similar to what we have done historically, and the quantum of salary hike also varies from geographies.

1238	\infosys\mar-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 In terms of the M&A, the focus will remain on what we are seeing in the digital space, there is more and more that we are seeing that we can scale up whether it is on cloud, cybersecurity, data and analytics. We are also looking at areas which are related to Internet of Things, we are looking at other parts of our business, which can also help us to be part of the digital transformation agenda for our clients whether that is in the area which relates to business, marketing, to sales, technology, engineering services and other areas, so those are all the places where we are looking in terms of what we could look for M&A. There is no fixed approach in terms of geography, we are always looking to see what we can do in services, but where we can have IP that supports that for our clients, we are open to that as well. The primary focus is really on digital and expanding our services team.	897		1	 The primary focus is really on digital and expanding our services team.

1248	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Sandeep. Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening to everyone joining on the call. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. We have had an exceptional year with an annual growth of 19.7% in constant currency terms, which is the fastest growth we have seen in 11 years. We are gaining market share. We are building on our leadership in cloud and digital, and we are a part of more and more programs that our clients are looking at in digital transformation.  4 Growth was broad-based across business segments, service lines and geographies. Each of our business segments grew in double digits. The top 3 grew in high teens, U.S. and Europe grew over 20%. The North America region crossed $10 bn in revenue, while Financial Services crossed $5 bn revenue milestones. Our digital revenues now account for 59.2% and grew at 41.2% for the year. Our digital revenues crossed $10 bn annualized on a run-rate basis. Within digital, our cloud work is growing faster, and our Cobalt Cloud capabilities have seen significant traction with our clients. Our growth has been accompanied by robust operating margins of 23.0%. We delivered these margins while maintaining focus on our employees with increased compensation and benefits. Our large deal wins were at $9.5 bn for the full year and were $2.3 bn for Q4. Our net new percentage was 40% for the year and 48% for Q4, helping us set up a strong growth foundation for financial year 2023. Our Q4 revenue growth was 20.6% YoY and 1.2% QoQ in constant currency terms. Our industry-leading performance in FY2022 would not have been possible without the relentless commitment from our employees. I am extremely proud as well as grateful for the extraordinary efforts in delivering success for our clients. Our last 12 months' attrition increased to 27.7%. Our quarterly annualized attrition declined by approximately 5 percentage points on a sequential basis. We recruited 85,000 college graduates in this financial year. In the fourth quarter, we had a net addition of 22,000 employees. We have an overall strong recruitment program. This is a reflection of our enhanced recruitment capabilities, solid brand and deep penetration into various talent markets. This increases our comfort to support clients in their digital transformation agenda as we look ahead. We have initiated our compensation review exercise for this financial year. We have planned this exercise so that we can focus on employee segments that need greater attention while also covering a broader group with regular increases. As in the past, we will look at  5 individual performance, skills and market benchmarks while determining individual compensation increases. We will focus on accelerated career growth, targeted development and opportunity to work on cutting-edge digital innovation globally. Our strategy launched 4 years ago has served us well. We have delivered industry-leading growth and industry-leading TSR. Looking ahead to the next phase to further enhance our leadership on the digital innovation curve, we plan to expand our capabilities in scaling our cloud business, expanding digital capability, expanding on our automation work and increasing relevance with our large clients and tech natives and also strengthen our employee value proposition. Our focus on staying ahead in the cloud and digital ecosystem, the focus on our employees and the costs give us strong confidence for the future. Our sustained momentum in FY2022, large deal wins, robust deal pipeline and client confidence give us comfort to guide for 13% to 15% growth in FY2023 in constant currency. As we look ahead – as we build our new strategy, that is looking at cloud and the digital ecosystem, our focus on employees and the costs related to the post-COVID work environment, result in our operating margin guidance to be at 21% to 23% for FY2023. In terms of our business segment performance, let me go through the highlights by segment. Financial Services segment grew at 14.1% in constant currency, with 8 large deal wins during the quarter and 27 large deal wins in FY2022. Our US business continues to lead the growth as we work on large transformation programs. Our overall large deal pipeline in Financial Services is healthy across the regions. Retail segment growth was at 16.5% in constant currency. As clients focus on digital and cost takeout programs. We are seeing integrated outsourcing deals and transformation programs in the areas of e-commerce, revenue growth management, supply chain, product life cycle management. We won 16 large deals from the segment in the last year and continue to have a healthy deal pipeline.  6 The Communications vertical grew strongly at 29.2% in constant currency. We see customer experience, IT and network simplification, lean and automated zero-touch operations, time to market and integrated data for digital enterprise as the key themes for clients in this segment. Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services segment growth increased further to 17.8% in constant currency. We see continued and increased emphasis on digital transformation, especially around customer experience, operational efficiency and associated legacy transformation. We won 4 large deals in the last quarter and 18 large deals in FY2022 from this segment. Growth in Manufacturing segment increased to over 50% in constant currency. There were 6 large deal wins in this segment in the last quarter and 13 wins for the last year. We are helping clients across engineering, IoT, supply chain, cloud ERP and digital transformation areas. Hi-Tech growth accelerated further to 20.9% in constant currency. We have seen an increase in deals based on edge computing, digital marketing and commerce. Cybersecurity is another area of focus for clients due to increased threat perception. Life Sciences vertical grew by 16.2% in constant currency. Clients are driving digital transformation of clinical trials to reduce cycle times through direct data capture, digital patient engagement to accelerate drug discovery, and reducing costs. In the last quarter, we were rated as a leader in 11 ratings in the areas of cloud services, big data and analytics, IoT and engineering, modernization and artificial intelligence. We announced the acquisition of oddity, a Germany-based digital marketing and experience and e-commerce agency. Together with Wongdoody, this will further strengthen our creative branding and experience design capabilities. With respect to capital allocation, the Board has proposed a final dividend of Rs.16 per share, taking the total dividend for financial year 2022 to Rs.31 per share, an increase of 14.8% over the past year.  7 I want to express Infosys' support for all the people impacted by the humanitarian crisis in Europe. The company advocates for peace between Russia and Ukraine. While Infosys does not have any active relationships with local Russian enterprises. We have a small team of less than 100 employees based in Russia, which service a few of our global clients. In light of the prevailing situation, we made a decision to transition these services from Russia to our other global delivery centers. To support this humanitarian assistance initiatives in the region, Infosys has committed $1 million towards Ukrainian relief efforts and is launching a program to digitally reskill up to 25,000 individuals. With that, let me hand it over to Nilanjan for his update.	7448		2	1% in constant currency, with 8 large deal wins during the quarter and 27 large deal wins in FY2022.

1249	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Thanks, Salil. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. We navigated yet another year of a challenging environment with strong growth of 19.7% in constant currency, which is highest in a decade. The incremental revenue added this year was higher than the incremental revenue added in the previous 3 years together. This was backed by broad-based growth across segments and robust growth in our digital portfolio at 41.2% in constant currency. Operating margin for the fiscal stood at 23.0%, which was at the midpoint of our guidance band of 22% to 24%. In the backdrop of various supply side pressures, we rolled out various measures to reduce attrition – higher compensation increases, higher promotions, skill-based interventions, etc. in addition to higher subcons. Free cash flows for FY2022 crossed $3 bn. DSO reduced by 4 days to 67 days. Capex increased marginally to $290 million on the back of continued focus on optimizing the infra creation-related spend. Consequently, FCF conversion as a percentage of net profit was 103% for FY2022.  8 FY2022 EPS grew by 14.3% in dollar terms and 15.2% in INR terms. Return on equity at 29.1% improved by 1.7% over the prior year. Coming to Q4 performance - Revenues grew by 20.6% YoY in constant currency and 1.2% sequentially. Growth was broad-based across verticals and geos and was in double digits. Although volume growth remained healthy in Q4, revenue growth in Q4 was impacted by usual seasonality, COVID impact during the early part of the quarter and the client related contractual provision, which we expect to recover in the future. This also impacted Q4 margins. Mining of large clients was extremely strong in FY2022. $100 mn client count increased to 38 compared to 32 in FY2021. We had 12 clients giving $200 mn annual revenues compared to 7 in FY2021. We have added ~22,000 net employees, including trainees during the quarter, the highest ever in the company's history, as we made headroom to capture the robust demand environment ahead. Consequently, utilization in Q4 declined to 87.0% while on-site effort mix inched up to 24.0%. Voluntary LTM attrition increased to 27.7%. While LTM attrition continues to increase due to the tail effect, quarterly annualized attrition saw a decline of approximately 5% after flattening in the previous quarter. Q4 margins stood at 21.5%, a drop of 200 basis points versus previous quarter. The major components of the sequential margin movement were as follows: - 1.6% impact due to lower calendar working days, client contractual provision as explained above and other pricing puts and takes, - 0.6% impact due to lower utilization as we create capacity for the future, - 1% due to higher visa costs, third-party costs and other one-offs, which we benefited in Q3, and these were offset by - approximately 1.1% benefit due to salary-related benefits, including lower working days, leave costs and others.  9 Q4 EPS grew by 9.2% in dollar terms and 13.4% in rupee terms on a YoY basis. Our balance sheet remained strong and debt-free. Consolidated cash and equivalents increased further to $4.9 bn at the end of the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was healthy at $761 million, and yield on cash balance remained stable at 5.29% in Q4. In line with our capital allocation policy, the Board has recommended a final dividend of Rs.16 per share, which will result in a total dividend of Rs.31 per share for FY2022 versus Rs.27 per share for FY2021, an increase of 14.8% per share for the year. Including the final dividend and recently concluded buyback over the last 3 years, we have returned 73% of FCF to shareholders under our current capital allocation policy. Our accelerated investments in the last few years in strengthening our digital footprint, enhancing large deal capabilities, localization, talent building has enabled us to gain consistent market share. With the acceleration of digital disruptions across industries, we see further scope to engage more closely with clients and capitalize on the expanding market opportunities. We have identified areas of investments, including doubling down our focus on digital portfolio, scaling our cloud offerings and further enhancing our capabilities in emerging technologies. We also remain committed to offer a compelling value proposition to employees through reskilling, incentivization and a holistic career growth. We plan to neutralize the impact of some of these through aggressive cost optimization and value-led pricing driven by service and brand differentiation. This, along with post-pandemic normalization of some expenses, like travel, facilities, etc, is reflected in the revised margin guidance for FY2023 of 21% to 23%. With the pandemic hopefully behind us, we hope to see many of you in person over the next few months. With that, we can open the call up for questions. Moderator  10 Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ankur Rudra The first question is on the revenue guidance. Last year at this time Salil, the revenue guidance was a bit low at the beginning of FY2022 and at that time I would say at least the order book was a lot stronger, you had a mega deal in the order book and perhaps a stronger exit rate. So curious to know, what gives the confidence of giving a slightly higher guidance at the beginning of this year, given, may be a more volatile macro situation.	5490		2	 We also remain committed to offer a compelling value proposition to employees through reskilling, incentivization and a holistic career growth.

1250	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Hi Ankur thanks for your question. What we see today is the demand environment from our client base is strong. We have for the year $9.5 bn in large deals, 40% net new, for the quarter $2.3 bn, 48% net new and a strong expansion in dimensions relating to new client work and relating to actual expansion across different strata. Given all those factors, we came to view that we could see growth in the range of 13% to 15% for this financial year. Ankur Rudra Understood this, does this bake in any kind of reversal that you alluded to from the client situation in fourth quarter?	580		2	 Given all those factors, we came to view that we could see growth in the range of 13% to 15% for this financial year.

1251	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 The client situation of the fourth quarter will reverse over some period. We have not specified that. That reversal in any case is not such that will make a huge impact in the full year. We see this coming really from the strong demand that we are seeing within the market from what we are seeing in the existing base of business that we have, the expansion within clients that we are seeing and some of the new client acquisitions that we are witnessing. So, putting all those factors we came to this view. Ankur Rudra  11 Thank you, appreciate this. The follow up question is on margin. Maybe to start with could you elaborate the third-party cost which went up sharply this quarter and last quarter. Is this the sticky new level given the nature of deals you are signing?

1252	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 I think many of the large deals which we get is through bundling our services with the software and the allied services and that gives us a multiplier effect in the client landscape. And that you have seen over the last few years, so that is one of the reason also you have seen the cost increase and has helped us in the quarter and the year going forward. On YoY perspective for FY2023 we do not call out the wage impact. As Salil said, it will be a competitive compensation hike. We will differentiate hike in talent and in some places, it will be more broad-based and of course around that we have a lot of cost optimization which we usually do. Some of them in the year past were tailwinds; for instance the onsite offshore mix. But subcon became a headwind for us last year and some of these in a way will start going the other way in the following year. Of course, the wage hikes will hit us early on the year as well in quarter one itself, so that will be initial headwind, but we have seen the overall impact of our cost optimization. On pricing, we have started discussions as Salil mentioned earlier with our clients. Of course, this is a much longer haul, it happens more on T&M, renewals etc. But for FP side of the business these are much more longer-term discussions. And these are also competitively bid but I think the discussions have started. All of our sales people are actively engaged in this and looking at the overall demand and the supply front on this and we have started making head way on this. Ankur Rudra Thank you and best of luck. Moderator  12 Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Moshe Katri Thanks for taking my questions. It would be great if you can give us some more clarity and the client specific contractual position that you mentioned is getting lot of questions from the investors. How does that impact the revenue numbers for the quarter. Is there a margin impact as well? I think any clarity is going to be really helpful. And this is a followup looking at the margin guidance for FY2023, I would see you have brought down by a 100 basis point. Are we assuming they picked up from the wage inflation here and then are we also assuming lower pricing power which is something that actually did help in terms of levers hardly for the past 6 to 12 months. Thanks a lot.	2377		2	 How does that impact the revenue numbers for the quarter.  Some of them in the year past were tailwinds; for instance the onsite offshore mix.

These are less than a percentage, so it is not a big impact overall as people are making it out. So we just want to close that out. It is not a big impact but less than 1%. But since you are looking at revenue growth sequentially, I just wanted to call it out.?

1254	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Okay Moshe , I could make out something you said about of wage inflation as well. So yes, in Q1, we will do a compensation hike as well both offshore and onsite and like I said it will be competitive. We will benchmark this, differentiate on talent side as well. And that is something we have seen over the last year has helped us, especially towards people with the higher skills set, so that is working for us.  13 The overall margin guidance reflects a number of events. We talked about some of the normalization of the pandemic benefits we have got on travel and facility, and some of that we are seeing is going to come back. And secondly, we are seeing some of the headwinds in terms of onsite-offshore which we think we have got a large benefit last year. So, we have to see how this opens up in the rest of the year. On the other hand, with our recruitment engine really kicking up now, we have seen subcon cost has actually plateaued during this quarter and we think for the rest of the year we should be able to pull back cost on subcon line. Automation remains very core to us – cost optimization every year. We are speaking of automating between 3000 to 4000 people and putting in BOTS and this I am talking about for the quarter, So, we have comprehensive plans and we have talked about pricing as well. 21% to 23% is a reasonable margin band we think we are comfortable to operate in for the next year. If you recall even pre pandemic in a way, we were in at 21% to 23% as we ended FY2020 which was the year before pandemic at 21.3% if I am not mistaken. So, we are at 21% to 23% and it is a comfortable range we are happy to be in. Moderator Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec.

1255	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nitin Padmanabhan 	 Hi good evening just two questions from my side. The first one was on the guidance. So, if I understand right, typically you have a high visibility for the next two quarters and if I look at the last year net new deal wins, it is actually lower than the prior year. So I was just wondering is the mix of much smaller deals which do not reflect within the overall large deal win number that you are talking about, is that a much higher number, is that we should think about it? Second is the pipeline of larger deals that could come through that is giving the confidence or is it the smaller deals? so that was the first question.	630		0	Hi good evening just two questions from my side.

First the pipeline that we see today is the largest  14 pipeline we have in terms of large deals so that gives us a good confidence. Our net new for the year is strong. We have good momentum exiting this financial year 2022, which gives us a good foundation for next year and we see continued traction within clients, as we are expanding as we are consolidating, as we are gaining market share, so that gives us added boost.

1258	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 On the wage inflation, outside India is definitely higher than what we were seeing last year and that will become a part of how we factor in our overall compensation increase. Wage inflation numbers in most of the western geographies are higher today than they were 12 months ago. On financial services while in the quarter we saw the QoQ was lower, the overall demand environment remains very strong for us in this segment. We see a good pipeline there. There were significant large deal wins for the year and in the quarter and we remain confident with the growth in financial services. In life sciences conversely, we had in the previous quarter several onetime large deals and that is what made the QoQ look softer. It is a smaller unit for us. So, there is much more volatility in that, but the underlying demand in life sciences looks to be in good shape. Moderator Thank you.

1260	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 I think firstly on the utilization we are still at the higher end at 87%. We want to bring this down. Now having said that, a lot of this will happen through the influx of freshers. So it is not a dollar for a dollar in that sense. The utilization will start impacting by putting in more freshers who are at a lower cost, but will still have a margin headwind. But if you looking for a math behind it there is no straight correlation because it is not one for one in that sense. So that is first. On attrition, yes, we think that this should come down in the following year. The impact that we are seeing now – the impact of putting freshers in – not only by us, but by the entire industry because it was a rotational churn issue across the industry. As the industry puts in freshers, there is a new source of supply across the industry as well. And finally the intervention which we are doing now as well. So, that is all factored into our 21% to 23%. We are also looking at investments, like Salil said, around cloud, around digital capabilities; and therefore that is also baked into the next year’s guidance.	1113		0	 Now having said that, a lot of this will happen through the influx of freshers.

My attrition is somebody else lateral and somebody else’s attrition is my lateral and therefore if the industry has to come out of this it is fundamentally through volume. Volume has to be through fresher, there is no other source of volume. Therefore, as we start pumping in more freshers send them for training put them into the bench and then get them into production.

1265	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Sudheer Guntupalli 	 Sure Sir. An extension of this question, the current exit margin rate in March 2022 and margin downgrade for FY2023 it gives a bit of a deja vu feeling of the exit margin and guidance situation exactly 3 years ago in March 2019. In fact, we were not staring at so many margin headwinds like we are now barring a bit of an elevated attrition at that time. So my  17 question is, is it fair to assume that for the next four quarters margin trajectory will trace somewhat of a similar path like getting FY2020 where the current delta in growth will likely take care of the delta in margin headwinds or do you see any major divergences in terms of how the pattern will play out over the next four quarters.	703		1	An extension of this question, the current exit margin rate in March 2022 and margin downgrade for FY2023 it gives a bit of a deja vu feeling of the exit margin and guidance situation exactly 3 years ago in March 2019.

Looking forward I think this question has been attempted in different ways by some of the earlier questions that came through, but if you were to kind of think about your guidance on revenue for the full year and think about what are the puts and takes in terms of any delta that you might see on demand, how comfortable do you feel that you have a cushion?

1268	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 The way we looked at our growth guidance, we really try to take a look at where is the demand today, what we have done with large deals, what we are seeing across many of our accounts. For example, if you see some of the statistics that we share, number of accounts over $100 mn or $50 mn- they have seen big movements over the last 12, 24, 36 months. So we have some view of how that will move in the coming year and then how we are working  18 on new account acquisitions and focus on that. Those are the things we built in, to build the guidance and that is the approach we take every year and in April as we look ahead and then as the year moves, as we get other information we try to then see how best to communicate what we are seeing in the demand environment. It’s the same approach that we will follow. So, it is difficult for example to say what does it mean there is a cushion and not cushion because at this stage what we see is what we are sharing which is 13% to 15% on the growth and in every quarter with the broad-based connection we have with clients and interactions across the industry we will continue to share what we see with respect to the demand environment.	1184		1	 Those are the things we built in, to build the guidance and that is the approach we take every year and in April as we look ahead and then as the year moves, as we get other information we try to then see how best to communicate what we are seeing in the demand environment.

1275	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 I think the way we are looking at it is, we put in place that strategy a few years ago. We built out deep capability across multiple areas – that was what we did in the first sort of 6 months, a year or so. We are now seeing over the last 4 years a good impact of that approach. We see a tremendous demand environment which we see across cloud, areas of digital, automation, and some of the new digital tech companies. We want to take that and build the capability deeper in those areas. We consider that now one time approach in the next few quarters to get it mobilized. It is not something which is going to be a continuous new activity for us and then we want to again like we did last time a shift into building capability from the operating  20 business itself. But since we see an inflection point in what we see as the opportunity set, we want to make sure we take advantage of that, keep our leading position with market share growth that we have had over the past 3-4 years and try to build on that for the coming 3 to 5 years.	1038		2	 But since we see an inflection point in what we see as the opportunity set, we want to make sure we take advantage of that, keep our leading position with market share growth that we have had over the past 3-4 years and try to build on that for the coming 3 to 5 years.

What kind of a outlook you are building in on the macro concerns around what is happening in the Eastern Europe or even the larger macro worries around the inflation in your end markets. Are you taking any impact of that, maybe in the second half of the year, or the guidance is more on an ‘as is’ basis and in case if there is any incremental deterioration in the macros that would be probably incremental to whatever the guidance that we have given.	539		1	Understand that, and the other question also was on your guidance on the revenue side.

1278	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Vibhor Singhal 	 Salil couple of questions again on the European part. My first question is that as you have already mentioned that our exposure to Russia and the other geographies as of now is limited, just wanted to basically understand, as we work for a lot of multinational clients who have operations across countries and in parts of Russia and Europe as well. So, what are the  21 conversations with those clients like. Is there a possibility of them maybe curtailing down this to some extent or is there some negativity in the conversation that is creeping in. Second, a more longer-term question on the same geography is that, over the last 2 to 3 years, in fact more than that last 4-5 years we have seen eastern Europe evolve as a destination for hiring for a lot of companies maybe in data analytics and many other domains. Do you believe that the current war situation has pushed that back by maybe a few quarters or years or do you think it is a temporary situation and once it resolves, the earlier attractiveness of eastern Europe vis-à-vis hiring for the specific domains will still come back as it was before?	1110		1	 Second, a more longer-term question on the same geography is that, over the last 2 to 3 years, in fact more than that last 4-5 years we have seen eastern Europe evolve as a destination for hiring for a lot of companies maybe in data analytics and many other domains.

Of course as we go through the next few quarters and so on we will see how it plays out depending on the duration and so on.

Today we have no center in Ukraine but the other areas we have been expanding in and that has developed quite well. We do not see an impact today – there might obviously be impact with centers in Ukraine.

So, if I just for that, your services revenue has dropped in a surprisingly strong demand environment. So how should we think about it? I mean is it that certain projects have come to an end and this is across the board, I mean we have seen decline in Life sciences both in North America and Europe.

1290	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes so firstly, volume growth sequentially has been very strong first point. Second point if you see our YoY, it is 20.6% versus 19.7% for the year. Our number for exit rate is higher than the average for the year. Number two our volumes growth sequentially is higher, we have added 22,000 people this quarter and I am assuming many of these are being hired to look for future demand and get them into production so that is the third signal we have got. Fourth if you see from a revenue perspective versus the volume increase we have seen. We have talked about the seasonality of quarter four, and if you look back over the last 5-6 years we have always had a seasonality of revenue versus volume in quarter four because of the working day impact. We have seen some COVID leave in the initial part of January  24 impacting us. We had this one off we have just talked about the commercial contract for one client and of course there are some other puts and takes. So I do not think you can just see quarter four in isolation. We would not have given a guidance of 13% to 15% - this is probably the highest guidance we have given at the start of the year in the last 10 years at least. So I think all the demand indicators and landmarks are looking very good.	1258		2	 So I do not think you can just see quarter four in isolation.

1294	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 So, our subcon costs are pretty much plateaued at around 11.1% in this quarter as a percentage of revenue, but from an exit headcount perspective it has actually come down. And the reason for this whole ramp up of this subcons is our recruitment engine was a bit behind. We were hiring 11,000, 12,000 people each quarter and the balance demand was being fulfilled by subcons. With us now getting into this mode of hiring freshers, we hired 22,000 people this quarter which is close to about 7% of the exit headcount. And as we look  25 ahead we will continue to push on the pedal in terms of recruitment and replace many of the subcons either through a replacement system or what we call a program of ‘subcon to hires’ in which we offer them a full time employment within the company. So, we have been doing that. We have been at the lowest of the industry in 2019-2020 in terms of subcon. So, we know where we have to get at. It may take us some time, a few quarters, but we know that's the margin lever we can press on.	1022		0	 With us now getting into this mode of hiring freshers, we hired 22,000 people this quarter which is close to about 7% of the exit headcount.

1299	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  26 No, so the last part is I think quite clear, if you have seen actually our large deal strategy which we announced in the beginning of FY2019, we were then doing about $3 bn large deal. So we went from $3 bn to $6 bn to $9 bn to $14 bn, so while large deals actually went up even our margins went up. So some of that impact which people fear, when we go into large deals in the initial part of the cycle, of course headwinds are there because clients want cost savings upfront. But we are clear about the deal tenure and how do we price the deal so that over a period of time we are able to take out costs from our various levers which we have and come closer to the portfolio margin. So that is something we have been doing for the last 3, 4, 5 years, 10 years in this industry. I think the impact we are talking about is much more about the investments we want to make around what we have seen in the past, the success of what we have done, and we think with this robust demand environment these are new capabilities we should invest in as we progress. And the usual headwinds which we talked about, the bigger differentiation is the pandemic cost normalizing and I think you all have the numbers in terms of travel, utilization, onsite-offshore, subcon. So, some of those you can start triangulating what is going to come back on return to normal.	1354		2	 But we are clear about the deal tenure and how do we price the deal so that over a period of time we are able to take out costs from our various levers which we have and come closer to the portfolio margin. 26 No, so the last part is I think quite clear, if you have seen actually our large deal strategy which we announced in the beginning of FY2019, we were then doing about $3 bn large deal.

So it takes some time as well and which is why utilization excluding trainees and including trainees you see the gap. We have an increase in the overall trainee count as well between quarter-to-quarter who have not been deployed in projects. But from a margin perspective I am not sure this is a big part of the headwind of H1vs. H2. I think the H1 impact because of the comp increase is upfront one which happens every year and you can go back 2 years and see that as well, but overall for the year at 21% to 23% we are quite comfortable.  28	713		2	Yes, these trainees have to go through the whole Mysore stint, then they go to the bench, they get reskilled on specialty skills, and then we lead them into production.

So, even if you look at the revenue growth excluding third party has marginal decline but at the same time you are also saying the volumes have gone up, so is it the offshore effort in this quarter has not actually gone down so why is the volume growth not getting reflected in the revenue growth ex pass through as a whole.

The second one is the COVID impact in the initial part of the year; and the third one is the one contractual provision which we made for a client. So I think these are the areas due to which you are not seeing that volume benefits flowing into revenue. Like Salil also said, we have seen strong sequential quarterly volumes. Moderator Thank you.

1309	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thank you everyone for joining us. I wanted just to reiterate a couple of points we all discussed and mentioned. First FY2022 was an extremely strong year for us – close to 20% growth, 23% margin. We are clearly taking market share and really connecting very strongly with our clients for all the digital and cloud work. As we go ahead we want to focus on the ever expanding opportunity set in cloud, digital, data, analytics, automation, and in doing that we want to make sure that we remain a leader in the pack and continue the market share taking that we have been doing. We also want to focus on our employees with increased engagement and increased methods of working with their compensation increases and career progressions. Putting all of that together we come to a growth guidance of 13% to 15% for this financial year 2023 and a margin guidance of 21%  29 to 23%. We have a strong outlook and we look forward to working with our clients and employees for this outlook to be delivered in financial year 2023. Thank you again everyone for joining and look forward to catching up during any of the one- on-ones in the quarter. Take care. Moderator Thank you very much members of the management.

1318	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Rishi. Good afternoon, good evening. Welcome to the campus after a long time, good to see all of you here and good to see all the energy in the room. We have had an exceptional year; this year with an annual growth of 19.7% in constant currency terms. This was the fastest growth that we have had in 11 years. We are gaining market share; we are building on our leadership in cloud and digital and we are working more closely with clients on their transformation programs. Growth was broad based across business segments, service lines and geographies. Each of our business segments grew in the double digits, US and Europe grew 20%, so a very strong performance all around. Our digital revenues now account for 59.2% of our company and they grew at 41.2% for the year. Within digital, our cloud work is growing faster, and our Cobalt cloud capabilities are seeing significant traction with our clients. Our growth has been accompanied by robust operating margins at 23%. We delivered these margins while maintaining focus on our employees with increased compensation and benefits. Our large deal wins were at $9.5 bn for the full year and $2.3 bn for the quarter. In Q4 our revenue growth was 20.6% year on year and 1.2% quarter on quarter in constant currency terms. Our industry leading performance in FY22 would not have been possible without the enormous contribution and commitment of all of our employees. I am extremely proud and grateful for the extraordinary efforts in delivering all the work for our clients.  4  We recruited 85,000 college graduates in this financial year. We added 22,000 employees in the fourth quarter. We have an extremely strong recruitment program; this is really a reflection of our enhanced recruitment capabilities, solid brand and deep penetration into various talent markets. This increases our comfort to support our clients in their digital transformation programs. As we look ahead, our sustained momentum in FY 22, large deal wins, robust deal pipeline and client confidence in our capabilities give us comfort to provide a guidance of 13% to 15% for growth in FY23, in constant currency terms. With the pace of digital disruption accelerating across industries, we see a robust demand environment and immense potential to partner with our clients. Our ‘One Infosys’ approach is serving us well to bring the best of Infosys in the service of our clients’ needs. Our strategy that we launched four years ago has really served us well. We have delivered industry-leading growth and industry-leading TSR. Now as we look ahead to the next phase, we want to further enhance our leadership along the digital innovation curve. We plan to expand the capabilities by scaling our cloud capabilities even further, expanding our digital work, expanding on our automation, increase relevance with large enterprises and the technology native companies and strengthen our employee value proposition. Our focus on staying ahead in the cloud and digital ecosystem, and the focus on employees, and some of the costs which are coming back after the COVID phase is behind us, result in operating margin guidance to be at 21% to 23% for FY23. With that, let me pause and open it up for questions.	3228		2	 Our focus on staying ahead in the cloud and digital ecosystem, and the focus on employees, and some of the costs which are coming back after the COVID phase is behind us, result in operating margin guidance to be at 21% to 23% for FY23.

This year again you are starting with a guidance of 13% to 15%, is there conservatism built into it? And the macro environment is far more uncertain now, economists are bringing down their GDP forecast, do you see any impact on technology budget as your client face a squeeze? And for Nilanjan, what led to the sharp 200 bps margin decline in Q4, your guidance 21% to 23% is also lower than the 23% that you closed FY22 with. What is the reason and what about pricing, do you see pricing being key in margin levers?	620		0	 And for Nilanjan, what led to the sharp 200 bps margin decline in Q4, your guidance 21% to 23% is also lower than the 23% that you closed FY22 with. 7% growth for FY23. 5  Salil, you started FY22 with a guidance of 12% to 14% and finally ended with 19.	increase underperformed wrong grow changed invest reported good said comments right correct yes progress contribute comment unclear positive over	estimates decline drop underperformed there wrong fall concerned grow invest negative guidance here uncertain continue profitability mixed good said comments right correct forecasts yes adjustments progress contribute forecast bearish unclear over
1321	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Rishi. The first question, let me start off with that. We see the demand environment to be robust today. Yes, the macro environment, there is a lot of talk going on, but in our pipeline and in the work that we are doing in digital and cloud we see a clear demand with our client base. Based on what we have had in terms of large deals $9.5 bn in FY22, $2.3 bn in the fourth quarter, 40% of our large deals being net new, 48% in the fourth quarter and what we are seeing in our pipeline going ahead gives us good confidence that this is the guidance in which we start the year at 13% to 15%. As the year progresses, we will see what the various forces are that will play into all of this. We have also had 22,000 net additions in terms of employees and that supports our view that we see a strong outlook in this current FY23.	834		2	The first question, let me start off with that. 3 bn in the fourth quarter, 40% of our large deals being net new, 48% in the fourth quarter and what we are seeing in our pipeline going ahead gives us good confidence that this is the guidance in which we start the year at 13% to 15%. 5 bn in FY22, $2.

1322	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 On the margin question first, on the quarter on quarter, I think we were clear at the beginning of the year, we gave a margin guidance band of 22% to 24% and we have ended up exact in the middle at 23.0%. So what we have achieved this quarter, a part of it has been planned as well. So, for instance in this quarter, utilization which is a big driver of margin has come down that was planned we were sitting at 88.5% - uncomfortably high for us and we have brought that down from 88.5% to 87% in this quarter. So that is one planned intervention we have done. We knew that margins will get impacted, some of it is seasonality of Q4 because the working and calendar days are lower from the previous quarter that also impacts margin and some of it has been some headwinds on the revenue side. We have taken a specific commercial contractual provision for a client which we expect to recover in the times ahead. But overall, I think we have added 22,000 people in this quarter and this is looking ahead for the demand environment and some of that cost pressure stem in the quarter ahead. But like I said, we are  6  very comfortable where we are for the year at 23%. Looking at 21%-23% we have seen what we want to do, as Salil talked about demand environment is very robust, making upfront investments behind talent both in terms of getting freshers earlier in advance and also looking at where we can invest ahead with the points which Salil talked about. We have seen the success of that in 2019 when we made these investments and the last four years have been a result of the market share gain as well. So that is one part of the margin and the second part is travel will come back. We have seen that already, some of the facilities cost as people come back to work. Those were the tailwinds due to COVID on the margin side and now some of that will return to norm and therefore at 21% to 23% is a comfortable band which we think we can operate in which builds in both of these impacts.	1988		0	0%.

Also, could you tell us what percentage of your revenue is from the platform business?

1324	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for that question. I think on the platforms and products, so first we have a very strong business as you know in Finacle in the banking sector, it is a completely digital core banking product today and we see continued traction in the growth that we are seeing there. We do not break that out individually, but we see good traction with that business. We also put together other platforms, for example we have a platform called Equinox, this platform is focused on e-  7  commerce, on retail companies. We had a large deal win in Q4 which is built on the Equinox platform, and we are starting to see traction across multiple of these areas that we’ve put in place. We have also had a platform on insurance with McCamish which is working well. We do not disclose the platform and product revenue break up, but we are comfortable with how we are seeing the growth and the traction in that at this stage. We have very strong partnerships with the global companies that have centers in India and we see a lifecycle with them at the early stages so if we look back 5-10 years and as you look ahead at the early stages there is a strong interest in partnering as they are scaling up, in the middle stages to make sure there is more efficiency and in the later stages to see if we can take those over and transform them and we are working with clients in all these different stages. We are in conversations, in actual work with clients where they are building out a new capability, we are in discussions with clients where they are looking to see if there is something we can take over and transform completely and all of that in between. Those are very important locations for the global clients, these are places from where the leadership of these centers in India are making global decisions for the companies and we are quite fortunate that we are partnering with many of them.	1882		2	 We have very strong partnerships with the global companies that have centers in India and we see a lifecycle with them at the early stages so if we look back 5-10 years and as you look ahead at the early stages there is a strong interest in partnering as they are scaling up, in the middle stages to make sure there is more efficiency and in the later stages to see if we can take those over and transform them and we are working with clients in all these different stages.

1327	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 First with respect to the situation in Europe. Infosys as a company, very much would like to see that the two sides come together and come to some agreement on peace. We have also launched fund of $1 mn to help on the humanitarian areas. Given what is going on in the region we have started to transition all of our work from our centres in Russia to our centres outside  8  Russia. We have less than 100 employees in Russia. We work with no Russian clients and the work we do is with small number of global clients in Russia for which as I just mentioned we have started the transition. So at this stage we have no impact within our business given what is going on from an Infosys perspective. Once again, we are very much concerned with what is going on the ground and we are doing everything we can to help. We are also providing some assistance for re-skilling of individuals that are displaced and seeing as they move to other geographies if they can work in some of our locations in Eastern Europe. We do not do any business with Russian clients today and we have no plans of doing any business going ahead. The Metaverse has been an incredible launch, I am glad you mentioned it. We have created an ecosystem, a Metaverse Foundry which was launched a few days ago. We are already in active discussions with several clients to start to see how they can use it. There are examples on AR/VR, there are examples that we are already using, for example the work we do in supporting ATP. There is active work in the manufacturing segment because there is a lot of use within the Metaverse of what is going on in supporting whether it is training, whether it is security, whether it is safety procedures, so lot of discussions. We are excited about it and our clients are excited about it.	1789		1	 Infosys as a company, very much would like to see that the two sides come together and come to some agreement on peace.

1329	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Chandra Ranganathan 	 Hey Salil and Nilanjan, I have questions for both of you, so please bear with me. Salil, I think Reema covered the Q4 numbers but you know it is still below what the street was estimating so are these one-off factors because Q1 you typically have a strong start to the year so are these one-off factors, will you sort of regain momentum because you do not have the mega deals that you had that cushioned you in the previous fiscal. I also wanted to ask you about first of all the whole controversy around Russia, you recently closed your presence there, there are also questions about Akshata Murthy’s stake in Infosys, well I know you have nothing to do with it, are these discussions happening at the Board level, are clients asking you about  9  it because North America and Europe is where you get a majority of your business, so how serious are those concerns? Questions for Nilanjan, attrition has zoomed to 27.7%, TCS is still at 17% so do you see this getting worse in the coming quarters before it gets better what are you doing to reign in attrition and if you can give us numbers in terms of the number of freshers hired in the previous fiscal and your fresher hiring target for this fiscal, if you can break that down for us, Thank you.	1249		1	 Questions for Nilanjan, attrition has zoomed to 27.

As you mentioned this is one-off, as Nilanjan was sharing with the client which relates to contract situation, we fully expect that this will be reversed in the coming quarters, we see very good momentum into our business as we look ahead. Our view is with the guidance we have given 13% to 15% growth and the fact that we have significant new number of recruits in Q4, 22,000, we have clear understanding that we are in a good place and the growth there is working well. With respect to the discussions in the UK, we have no comments to make on any individual shareholders. Our approach on Russia I just outlined, we are transitioning our work from Russia, and we have real concern for what is going on, on the ground and we are providing humanitarian support and help on that.	861		2	 Our view is with the guidance we have given 13% to 15% growth and the fact that we have significant new number of recruits in Q4, 22,000, we have clear understanding that we are in a good place and the growth there is working well.

1333	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy  	 Just to add to Salil’s point. I think in Q4 if you see our year on year growth, we end the year at 20.6%, the full year is 19.7%, it is very important not to get fixated just on the quarter, so our exit velocity is very high, the volumes are very good for the quarter. There is some seasonality on the revenue line as well, which I talked about, but I think overall giving the guidance of 13% to 15% - I do not recall in the last 10 years that we have given such a guidance. So, your question was on attrition and the freshers hiring. So, in the last year we have hired 85,000 freshers across, both globally and in India and the year before, the pandemic year I don’t think there were many hiring - maybe few thousands. We are planning to do upwards of 50,000 at least and we will see how that plays out but that is just initial, and the good news is we have these two bright gentlemen who have mastered the art of off campus recruitment. Earlier the engine used to just go to the campus and they actually did not have any flexibility in volumes. Today we have that flexibility to ramp up volumes anytime and this year we had no idea that we would be able to service a 20% demand with a limited fresher set. So, that is working very well. Attrition is 27.7% on a LTM basis, which is last 12 months. Actually, attrition for the quarter has come down by close to 5% - both in percentage and in absolute headcount. In last quarter attrition had actually stabilized and in this quarter, we are seeing rduction both as a percentage and number for the quarter. The tail effect you are seeing - on an annual basis will continue to climb, but the good news is we have seen some of the stability and hopefully with the interventions we are looking ahead and with the April 1, comp hike planned we should continue to see some improvement in that.	1837		2	I think in Q4 if you see our year on year growth, we end the year at 20. 7% on a LTM basis, which is last 12 months. 6%, the full year is 19.

1343	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 In Eastern Europe, putting aside the geopolitical point that you mentioned I think we have a plan of expanding in Eastern Europe we have strong locations in multiple geographies, we are growing all of those locations. We had an approach as you know over the last few years for localization and in that light, we have already expanded quite significantly whether it is Poland or Romania, and we will continue to expand in the Eastern European geography. We have work that is done there and is really strong, and we believe that it will continue to expand. As we were both mentioning, our approach to attrition, our approach to employee engagement, we are making huge changes there and we are seeing increased numbers internally on what we track with employee engagement, employee connect. What we have done as a company  13  through the COVID period has really resonated with our employees in the flexibility and we have provided the support and care, complete support around any medical issues, the vaccination program that we ran among other things for our employees. In terms of the base location, our approach to return to work has been to work keeping in mind what our clients are looking for and keeping in mind what our employees are comfortable with, we are slowly moving work back onto campus. We understand that some of our employees are of course not in the primary location and today the work from home is working extremely well, so what we build as we go through the next several months and quarters will be with that flexibility with a tremendous advantage to the employees with the flexibility and we will keep in mind what our clients are looking for. There are certain requirements within some clients and some industries which will require some of those teams to come back sooner and then over time with this massive recruitment from colleges we also want to be aware and responsive to how we build the culture within the company going ahead and rebuild our social capital. But all of those will be done in keeping the best interest of our clients, employees and the company in mind.	2101		2	In Eastern Europe, putting aside the geopolitical point that you mentioned I think we have a plan of expanding in Eastern Europe we have strong locations in multiple geographies, we are growing all of those locations.

Like I mentioned earlier, as we look ahead into the year we are very clear there is a very robust demand environment which we need to capture and this also calls for investments to be made upfront. We already talked about utilization, putting freshers early into the mix, hiring 22,000 employees even before we start next year and some of the other headwinds of the pandemic which we enjoyed in a way as tailwinds which was the travel, which was also facilities, etc., and some of that will come back. We, of course have a very strong cost optimization program which we run throughout the year, this is elements of onsite, offshore mix as you all know it is about the pyramid, it is about automation at scale, we put bot factories across all our delivery lines, so these are reusable resources and assets which we can deploy into our many of our fixed price projects, subcontractors cost which were massive headwind for us and my friends here from the recruitment team are going to solve it this year to get us a tailwind on subcontractor, so 21% to 23%, that margin band we are comfortable with. And like I said, pricing is another element we are talking to our clients, of course this is a much more longer term discussion because it only happens largely with renewals, but we can go and start pushing for things like COLA, change request, etc. but that is something which we really are trying to press our pedal on with our sales folks.

We feel attrition is definitely something which we have seen a small decline from the previous quarter, and we will watch it to see how it plays out in the quarters ahead. In terms of the client spend we see today our pipeline is actually very strong, we see in all of our discussions, clients are more and more ready to spend much more focused on the cloud area, very much on the data analytics business, on IoT, and lots of discussion on automation which also has impact in cost and efficiency.

We will wait and watch how that plays out, but in our pipeline today, in our discussions today we do not see any change to what they are doing with the project they are thinking of, with the transformation they are looking at, with the cost and efficiency they are looking at.	481		1	So, on the first point, the clients that we are working with, and we are interacting with in Europe today we do not see any impact of the situation between Ukraine and Russia directly with those clients.

1355	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes, on the return to work. We have a three-phase plan. In fact, we have rolled out in April itself, so the first phase is people who are in the home locations so in the DCs where they are,  17  whether it is in the base DC or they are in the upcountry town which is close to a DC we are encouraging people to come at least twice in a week, eight days in a month into the DCs and we are already seeing a lot of traction there. Senior leaders already coming in and teams are already having huddles, etc. that is the first phase. We are also now encouraging people - and that is part of phase two - who are outside the DC town to start making preparations over the next few months to see if they can come back into the base DC. This is again based on the individual circumstance, etc. and then over a longer period of time we are looking at more hybrid sort of work, of course that will depend on clients. It will depend on regulatory environment and a number of other considerations so this will be a phased approach and we are seeing it really each quarter.	1058		2	 It will depend on regulatory environment and a number of other considerations so this will be a phased approach and we are seeing it really each quarter.

Infosys’s attrition has gone up to 27.7% from 10.9% in the last one year despite all the measures put in place it is a tight talent market. Do you see a downward spiral in the coming months and the second question is the subcontracting expenses have gone up substantially to Rs.16,000 crore from little over Rs.9,500 crore in the last one year?

1360	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 You know just to add Salil saying on attrition. I think firstly it is important to understand is we are in an environment where demand is chasing supply. I mean this is an industry to be in, right. If you are in industry where at least supply chases demand you have ten times worse problems, so that in a way is a good problem to have, and the way we have to fulfill this demand is through freshers, right otherwise attrition is rotational and it is net zero game. My attrition is somebody else lateral and somebody else attrition is my lateral. So, end of the day the fresher has to feed into the entire system across all companies. We have put 80,000. There are larger players. Somebody who is put 100,000 plus. So once these freshers feed in they take three to four months to come into production, etc. and that is the time you will start seeing benefit of this coming into the overall macro environment of hiring market as well, now until then you have to make sure that you are also meeting that demand and not leaving demand on the table which is why you go for subcons. You of course have to pay higher for lateral compensation, etc. but like I said this is an opportunity to grab demand. These are deals which are for five years, seven years. You do not want to leave them on the table because you are not able to fulfill them for a year and so I think over a period of six months etc. definitely with freshers coming in into the entire industry and you will see a moderation of this from a more macro prospective and subcons is one of them where we are already seeing a plateauing of our subcon costs. I think the last quarter and this quarter and of course we have planned as part of the year this will definitely ramp down.	1735		1	 These are deals which are for five years, seven years.

1363	\infosys\mar-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 So the metaverse foundry launch was a huge success for us. What we have are a set of assets, which form a part of this metaverse foundry. These are ways in which we can help our clients as they are considering their journey into the Metaverse. So let us say there are different segments in the manufacturing segment. There are clients who are considering how they can use this in terms of replicating actions on a factory floor and on training on various areas. When you are in retail, people are looking at the metaverse concept to demonstrate various aspects of their products to engage with the new customer who is more present in the metaverse. We have created a set of asset which can help our clients to engage in that activity and there are several discussions which are ongoing which give us good comfort that this is starting to become important. Internally we have some goals we have set for ourselves, which we want to drive through and as and when we see some of those things that we can share outside as well. Those are internal goals because we see some of the things that we have in place there, are giving us tremendous traction. We will also have this as part of the living labs that we have in different locations all around. We will also have this when we do events with clients. We have a way to showcase some of this and so it is starting to come into it, but there are some internal goals we have set for this.	1433		2	 These are ways in which we can help our clients as they are considering their journey into the Metaverse.

They are trying to rework their supply chains given all of that is going on globally and we are a part of those discussions. We see good demand in Financial Services which is our largest industry segment. There we are part of areas where this is really Ops and Tech transformation programs where clients are looking to have someone who can help them with the transformation of their operations while we infuse technology and create a modernized estate for them. We have good demand in the Manufacturing segment where we see clients looking at leveraging the IoT infrastructure, leveraging what is going on with the cloud and the data center evolutions. So the demand is broad based across many of our industry segments today and we see that looking good in terms of our pipeline as we look out to this financial year.	1101		2	So on the demand environment, we see good demand across many industries and there are different dynamics in each of the industries.

1386	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Rishi, and good evening everyone here for joining in, and thank you for being here on the campus. We had an excellent full year performance in Financial Year 2023, with a growth of 15.4% in constant currency. Our digital business grew at 25.6%, now being 62.9% of our overall revenue. And our core services grew as well at 1.9%. We had 95 large deals with a value of $9.8 bn for the year, 40% of which were net new. Our operating margin for the full year was at 21%, and our attrition has continued to decline in each quarter of the year, including in Q4. We are leveraging generative AI capabilities for our clients and within the company today, we have active programs and projects with clients, working with generative AI platforms to address specific areas, processes, and libraries within their business. We have trained open- source generative AI platforms on our own internal software development libraries. We anticipate generative AI to provide more opportunities for work with our clients and to enable us to improve our own productivity. In Q4, we saw changes in the market environment. During the quarter, we saw unplanned project ramp-downs in some of our clients and delays in decision-making which resulted in lower volumes. In addition, we had some onetime revenue impact. While we saw some signs of stabilization in March, the environment remains uncertain. This led to our Q4 year-on-year growth of 8.8% in constant currency and quarter-over-quarter decline of 3.2%.  	1495		2	8% in constant currency and quarter-over-quarter decline of 3.

Our pipeline of large deals is extremely strong. Several of these are mega deals and several of them are opportunities for cost and efficiency programs within clients and consolidation opportunities. Based on our sustained momentum in the financial year '23, the strong pipeline of opportunities, especially the ones in cost efficiency and consolidation, while also keeping in mind the uncertain environment, our revenue growth guidance for this financial year is 4% to 7% in constant currency.

1389	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Ritu Singh 	 Hi Salil, Hi Nilanjan. Your constant currency revenue decline for the quarter is far worse than what the street was expecting. And then that sort of explains why your full year revenue growth guidance is missed, what you guided at 16% - 16.5%. I just wanted to understand where are you seeing softness? I remember reading your comments that your exposure to US banks isn't that large. What are the verticals that are seeing softness? And also on your margin guidance, which now for FY’24, you’ve brought to about 20% to 22%. Again, last year, we thought it was an aberration because of higher wage bills, and the expectation was that it would be brought back to 21% to 23%, which is not the case. Could you tell us a bit more about why this? And a second question on attrition as well, which has been coming down. If you expect that trend to continue in your hiring plans for the year, please? Thank you.	905		0	 Again, last year, we thought it was an aberration because of higher wage bills, and the expectation was that it would be brought back to 21% to 23%, which is not the case.

Nilanjan will share a little bit about the margin and the other points we will come back to as well. On what we saw in Q4, during the quarter, we saw some ramp-downs which were unplanned, and these were across different sectors. We saw some in Telco. We saw some in Hitech, some in Retail and within Financial Services, it was on mortgages that we have talked about in the past, in Asset Management and Investment Banking. So those were the areas in which we saw things which were unplanned. In addition to that, we saw some onetime impact in the quarter. Now in terms of the margin, go ahead please.	667		1	April 13, 2023  Page 5 of 23  Let me start off with the market.  Now in terms of the margin, go ahead please.

1391	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Yes, I'll take that. So, we have ended the year, as you know, at 21%, and this has been pretty stable as the year has gone by. So, 21% was the full year margin as the exit margin as well. And in a way, it's a midpoint between 20% and 22%. It gives us the flexibility in this year as well. So, we will have some headwinds which we will see with compensation, we will have some travel coming back. But we know with things like utilization, more automation, etc., we also have a runway to increase the margins. But this gives us the necessary flexibility into next year.	568		2	So, we have ended the year, as you know, at 21%, and this has been pretty stable as the year has gone by.

We have several methods in which we can do better in that program, whether that relates to automation, it relates to pyramid, it relates to onsite mix, relates to subcontractors, relates to travel. And also relating to pricing and how we can drive that within our system, given the inflation that all of us have seen. What we are communicating with that is that program gets a very focused attention. And we have within our internal way of looking at it, a path to bring us to the aspired margin that we want, because we want to be at that margin as we go ahead. Having said that, we have low utilization that Nilanjan mentioned. We are going to make sure that we look after our people with that commitment. We are going to make sure that we continue with the training, and that is an area we will continue our focus on.

One, on the incremental revenue, so as you know, we don't give a specific dollar number for that. But our guidance very clearly allows you to interpret it as 4% to 7% constant currency growth on the base, which now is closed on March 31. So, both reported and constant currency, we have those numbers. But that is our guidance, which will therefore give you the incremental revenue. On what our clients are telling us. Now several industries where we have talked about, Telecom, Retail, Hitech, and parts of Financial Services, there are some clients which are seeing in their own business, whatever constraints they're seeing with the economic environment. As a consequence, we have noticed that some decisions were made during the quarter to stop some parts of the programs, not everything, but some parts of the program. And that's what we observed in the quarter. Plus, what Nilanjan and I also shared, there was some one-time impact in the quarter. Now, what we see going ahead, we saw some stabilization in March, but the demand environment is still uncertain. In the last quarter, we saw that certain banking situations were in the US and European geographies, impacting decision-making across the board. With that in mind, we are working very closely with our clients and supporting them, making sure that we remain committed to our clients as they go through their way of dealing with the situation that's changing. And we believe that as we did in the past, the clients connect with us will help us massively in the future as well.

We actually had, I think, hired 51,000-odd last year. And a lot of them on the bench are getting skilled, are getting trained. So, we have quite a leeway for the next few quarters in terms of the availability of freshers. And of course, with our agile model of doing both college and off-campus recruitment, we can always turn that up. So, we have no specific number for FY’24 at this stage. We have enough, actually, today sitting on the bench.	582		1	 We actually had, I think, hired 51,000-odd last year.  And a lot of them on the bench are getting skilled, are getting trained.

Why are these deals getting delayed? And on the ChatGPT part that you mentioned, are there any specific use cases that you guys are working on?

We see that across the different industries that I mentioned, Telecom, Hitech, Retail, and parts of Financial Services. So, I don't know whether it's sentimental or structural, but we have seen that as the way the clients have interacted with us. As we were sharing, we saw some stabilization in March, but the environment is uncertain, so we will see how it plays out. On Generative AI, we are working with multiple platforms. We are working with open-source platforms, and we are working with proprietary platforms. We have active client projects today. The projects that we are working on are focused on large models within the client organization for different areas. And how Generative AI can take advantage of those large models and create something more efficient for the client. And then, we are working on our own software development tool, on an open-source Generative AI platform. We are actually working with two of them. And we are building, we are training it on our software development libraries. We have already done that with several of our internal software library elements. And we feel quite good that these things are going to help us with client work, so more work and also with productivity. So, it's really incredible how we think our organization has moved quickly into driving Generative AI within our business. And it’s now part of all the new training as well because once you have it for your own software library, you can really deploy it very effectively.	1623		1	April 13, 2023  Page 13 of 23  So there, what we are seeing is some clients have made a decision to slow down or ramp-down projects.

I understand the SVB crisis, the banking crisis, the Credit Suisse, and UBS crisis, but was it expected? I mean such kind of deep cuts for Infosys as such from a revenue perspective? And secondly, the kind of revenue outlook you have given for the current financial year. Is this a long-term trend you are going to see that the overall growth rate is going to be under single digit -- maybe high single-digit or below 10% kind of thing?  	600		0	The next question is from PP Thimmaya from YourStory.

And we build in a bottom-up way, what our estimate is and what our forecast is for the period ahead for the financial year. And that's the guidance update or change that we gain, and we have given that consistently over the last several years. We saw a different kind of volume when we were at the end of last quarter. And then things changed during the quarter, which is what we shared with the projects ramping down. Now looking ahead, first, if you look at, let's just say, the last couple of years, we had 19.7% growth the year before, and 15.4% this past year. So, we know that it depends on where the economic environment is and how we see that. We think our business has two growth drivers. When there is a huge change going on within our client organizations and they are putting in large investments there. There is digital transformation, and we have deep capability in that. That comprises the cloud. We have a very strong capability on Cobalt. And then, when there are different areas where the client wants to focus on efficiency, costs, and even consolidation. We have a very strong capability in automation, our own AI that we have used for that in the past. So, we feel comfortable on both of those dimensions depending on how the economic environment is.	1371		1	 So, we know that it depends on where the economic environment is and how we see that.

So, the question is, this weak, I mean, the soft outlook, is it going to drill down to your plans for hiring next year, as well as the increments and the variable pay? That is one. And do you see a recovery period over the next few quarters? Like, I mean, one or two quarters from where, you feel that the situation in North America will stabilize, or at least, if you have a hint? Also, is the softness overall coming from North America, or you are seeing pockets of softness from other regions as well, like Europe? And you also mentioned about the Generative AI. So, I just want to know whether this is in association with Open AI, where you have some stake, or how it's going to play?	714		0	 Like, I mean, one or two quarters from where, you feel that the situation in North America will stabilize, or at least, if you have a hint.

I think it is the biggest source of our margin improvement. And of course, with new tools coming in, I think we can see more-and-more productivity increases. The one which is sitting out there really is utilization. I think at 80%, we know we have a large headroom to improve that. Onsite offshore mix, which post-COVID, slightly went a skew because, of course, there was some travel which went back. That now strategically can be looked at and as we can offshore more work. Definitely on the pyramid side as well. So, as freshers' go into the pyramid, you will get a benefit really on the production workforce. So today, the bench has a double whammy on cost because you have idle people and, of course, you have a rich pyramid in terms of a very top- heavy pyramid. And as freshers' go in, you will be having that benefit as well. So, there are multiple levers, which we have. Pricing is one of them. Salil mentioned that as well. We continue to work with our clients where we can put COLA clauses into our deals, where we can sell with new innovative commercial constructs. Of course, the environment is tough. The good news is we have not seen, for instance, a return back to a heavy discounting environment. We are making sure that we are continuing to push back on our clients on discounts, etc., and that really has stayed even during this time.	1505		2	 Onsite offshore mix, which post-COVID, slightly went a skew because, of course, there was some travel which went back.

These were spread across different industries. There were some in Telecom, some in Hitech, Retail and parts of Financial Services. We see some stabilization in March, but the demand environment is uncertain. So, we will watch it and with agility and adapt to it.	432		2	 There were some in Telecom, some in Hitech, Retail and parts of Financial Services.

1492	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Sandeep. Good evening and good morning to everyone on the call and thank you for joining us. For the full financial year 2023, we had a good performance with growth of 15.4% in constant currency. Our digital business grew 25.6%, now being 62.9% of our overall revenue and our core services grew as well at 1.9%.  We saw broad based growth across our business segments, with most in double digits. We had 26% growth in Europe and 12% in the US. We had 95 large deals with a value of $9.8 bn for the year, with 40% net new. Our operating margin for the full year was at 21%. We generated free cash flow of $2.5 bn in the year. Our attrition has continued to decline in each of the quarters through the year. We are leveraging generative AI capabilities for our clients and within the company. We have active projects with clients working with generative AI platforms to address specific areas within their business. We have trained opensource generative AI platforms on our internal software development library. We anticipate generative AI to provide more opportunities for work with our clients and to enable us to improve our productivity. In Q4, we saw changes in the market environment. During the quarter, we saw unplanned project ramp downs in some of our clients and delays in decision making, which resulted in lower volumes. In addition, we had some one-time revenue impacts. While we saw some signs of stabilization in March, the environment remained uncertain. This led to a Q4 year-on-year growth of 8.8% in constant currency and quarter-on-quarter decline of 3.2%. Our operating margin was at 21% for the quarter and we had $2.1 bn in large deals in the quarter. We generated $713 mn of free cash flow in the quarter. Our pipeline of large deals is extremely strong. Several of these are mega deals and several of these opportunities are for cost and efficiency programs and for consolidation projects. Some industries such as financial services (in Mortgages, Asset Management, Investment Banking), Telecom, Hi-Tech and Retail are more impacted, leading to uncertainty in spend and delays in decision making. The US geography is more impacted than Europe. Keeping in mind the current environment, we have further expanded our internal efficiency and cost program to work on our pyramid, onsite ratio, automation, travel,  subcontractor cost, office consolidation and on pricing. We anticipate this program will build a path to higher margins in the medium term. We are committed to investing in our people in this period. We are committed to working with our clients as we deal with changes in the economic environment. Based on our sustained momentum in financial year ‘23, a strong pipeline of opportunities, especially focused on cost, efficiency and consolidation, while also keeping in mind the uncertain environment, our revenue growth guidance for this financial year is 4% to 7% in constant currency. Operating margin guidance for this financial year is 20% to 22%. Thank you. With that, let me hand it over to Nilanjan.	3050		2	 We anticipate generative AI to provide more opportunities for work with our clients and to enable us to improve our productivity. 4% in constant currency.

1493	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Thanks, Salil. Good evening, everyone. And thank you for joining this call. FY ‘23 was a year of two halves, mirroring broader macroeconomic conditions. Growth was extremely strong in H1 with 20%, year-on-year constant currency which reduced to 11.2% in H2 due to the slowdown in verticals like telecom, high-tech, retail, and parts of financial services. Q4 came in slower than expected due to some specific client ramp-downs in discretionary spend and delayed client decision-making on new deals. In addition, we had some one-off revenue impacts, including project cancellations, etc. Despite the above, we closed FY ‘23 with a strong 15.4% growth in constant currency, leading to continued market share gains. Operating margins for Q4 and FY ‘23 were at 21% in line with our guidance. Free cash conversion to net profit for FY ‘23 was near 85%. FY ’23 EPS grew by 1.3% in dollar and 9.7% in rupee terms. Client metrics were strong with the number of $50 mn clients increasing to 75, $100 mn client counts increasing to 40, and $200 mn client counts increasing to 15. LTM voluntary attrition declined to 20.9%. Quarterly annualized attrition reduced by over 4% sequentially and is the lowest in the last nine quarters. This is also well below pre-pandemic levels.  Coming to Q4 performance, revenues grew by 8.8% year-on-year and declined by 3.2% sequentially in constant currency terms due to the reasons mentioned earlier. Utilization declined to 80% on the back of softness in demand. We expect the utilization to improve gradually in the coming quarters as freshers starts getting deployed. We will calibrate the hiring for FY’24 based on available pool of employees, growth expectations and attrition trends. Q4 margins were at 21%, which is a decline of 50 basis points sequentially. Major components of sequential margin movements are - tailwinds of 50 basis points on cost optimization, including reduction in sub- con. - 60 basis points benefit from reduction in PSCS, which is post sale customer support. Offset by a headwind of about - 70 basis points from a drop in utilization and - the balance 90 basis points with a combination of revenue one-timers as mentioned above, partly offset by other savings. Q4 EPS grew by 0.2% in dollar terms and 9% in rupee terms on a year-on-year basis. Our balance sheets remained strong and debt-free. Consolidated cash and equivalents stood at $3.8 bn at the end of the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was robust at $713 mn with a conversion of 95% to net profit. Yield on cash balance was 6.66% in Q4. The board has recommended a final dividend of ₹17.50 per share, which will result in a total dividend of ₹34 per share for FY ‘23 versus ₹31 per share for FY ‘22, an increase of 9.7% per share for the year. Including the final dividend and recently concluded buyback, we have returned 86% of FCF to shareholders over the last four years under our current capital allocation policy. In Q4, we completed the open market share buyback of ₹9,300 crores, buying back 1.44% of shares at an average buyback price of ₹1539 versus a maximum buyback price of ₹1850.  ROE increased to 31.2% in FY ‘23 from 29.1% in FY ’22 as a result of higher payout to investors. Coming to segment performance, Large deal momentum continued, and we signed 17 large deals in Q4. TCV was $2.1 bn with 21% net new. Five large deals were in manufacturing, four in FS, three in CRL, two each in Life Sciences and Hi-Tech, and one in EURS. Region-wise, this was split by ten in America and seven in Europe. In FY ‘24, we signed 95 large deals with TCV of $9.8 bn with 40% net new. Coming to vertical segment performance, Financial services vertical was impacted by budgeting delays at the start of the year led by macroeconomic uncertainty coupled with softness in mortgages, asset management and investment banking. However, our strong pipeline and large deal-wins in areas like infra, production support, cybersecurity and business operations is helping in better visibility for FY ‘24. We have a very diverse portfolio of clients in the US and hence, exposure to multiple regional banks is less than 2% of our overall revenues. We do not anticipate any material impact on our operations as a result of recent news and regional banking segment. In Retail, there is heightened focus on accelerating digital transformation to enable top line growth with rigor in ensuring budgets get spent on right programs to maximize ROI. While there is some pressure on discretionary tech spending, companies are prioritizing investments in key areas such as e-commerce platforms, supply chain management systems and customer engagement tools. Manufacturing segment continues to see ramp-up of large deal wins and benefits of vendor consolidation. There is increased focus on digital spend, including opportunities on ER&D, 5G and industrial IoT. Increased energy prices and interest rates coupled with continuous supply chain disruptions is impacting spend on the run side of the business, especially in Europe. Communications segment is witnessing increased opex pressures, cost cutting ramp- downs and delayed decision-making. Demand for ideas and solutions are moving from cost takeout to revenue growth side with heavy focus on customer success. Cloud and  mobility remain top driver for 5G adoption. Overall pipeline remains strong, which gives us the confidence of growth opportunities in the coming quarters. The positive momentum in energy utilities resources and services for FY '23 was supported by large deal wins. Our renewed strategy to re-pivot our offerings and developing integrated Energy as a Service solution and the focus on the journey to net- zero initiative has positioned us well ahead of competition. While we are seeing delays in kicking off discretionary spend projects, the cost takeout and vendor consolidation initiatives continue to pick momentum. We expect our revenues to grow by 4% to 7% in constant currency terms in FY '24. Our pipeline of large deals remains extremely strong with increased focus on cost takeout programs. Operating margin guidance stands at 20% to 22%. The margin guidance factors in growth assumptions for FY '24, impact of utilization, employee cost increases, further normalization of costs like travel, facilities, etc. We continue to focus on various cost optimization and efficiency improvement measures. As we look beyond FY '24, we believe we have various levers to generate more efficiencies like improving utilization, reducing subcons, improving pyramid apart from growth acceleration and potential pricing increases, which will enable us to aspire for higher margins over time. With that, we can open up the call for questions. Moderator Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and- answer session. Our first question is from the line of Yogesh Aggarwal from HSBC. Please go ahead.	6901		0	 However, our strong pipeline and large deal-wins in areas like infra, production support, cybersecurity and business operations is helping in better visibility for FY ‘24.  60 basis points benefit from reduction in PSCS, which is post sale customer support.

Growth was extremely strong in H1 with 20%, year-on-year constant currency which reduced to 11.  Operating margins for Q4 and FY ‘23 were at 21% in line with our guidance.  We continue to focus on various cost optimization and efficiency improvement measures.

1494	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Yogesh Aggarwal 	 Yes, hi, good evening, couple of questions. Firstly, while the quarter was weak, the guidance at the upper end still looks very solid when we just mathematically look at the sequential build up from here. So, is that 7% based on some macro pickup or is it what you see today 7% is possible? And related to that, Salil, in general, the demand and the growth picked up post-COVID. So are we back to pre-COVID growth rate of 5%, 6%,  7% or FY '24 is one-off? And we can see a pickup from FY '25. And then I have a follow-up, please.	530		2	Yes, hi, good evening, couple of questions.  So are we back to pre-COVID growth rate of 5%, 6%,  7% or FY '24 is one-off.

1495	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Hi, Yogesh, this is Salil. I didn't catch the second one. I'll go with the first question, then you can just repeat the second one. On the guidance, what we have built it with today is, what we see with the deals we have sold and the ongoing work that we have and then put the range between 4% and 7%. There are different scenarios in which different things happen. We have widened the band to three points given the uncertainty in the environment. We also have a very strong large deal pipeline with some mega deals in the pipeline. Of course, these are always binary. But given the strength of the pipeline, we believe that there is, ways that we can achieve the high end of the band of guidance.	699		1	 But given the strength of the pipeline, we believe that there is, ways that we can achieve the high end of the band of guidance.

1496	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Yogesh Aggarwal 	 Got it. So, I was asking, the second question was 4% to 7% is almost going back to pre- COVID growth rate. So, is it like the new normal again or we can expect some pick up again from FY '25? That is one. And also, Salil, I wanted to ask you on the recent management exits. Just recently, you had two Presidents and COO. Now all three are not there for whatever reasons. So, has it impacted the business by any chance? And what is the new structure? Are you going to replace them or is it in, the new structure doesn't need Presidents and COO.	544		1	So, I was asking, the second question was 4% to 7% is almost going back to pre- COVID growth rate.

1497	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 So, on the first one, as of course, we don't provide a view or a guidance beyond this financial year. Underlying the way we see the business, we see two growth drivers. And we are well positioned on both in terms of capabilities and track record. One is on digital transformation, comprising of cloud and other elements and one is on cost efficiency, automation and an additional element, which is on consolidation that comes in through that. We see both of those drivers working. We have seen a reduction in the digital transformation work today. We see more in the cost and efficiency and consolidation play today. But going through and depending on where the client is, what the environment is, we feel comfortable for both of those drivers to work over time.  In terms of the structure, we have put in place a structure for the delivery organization, which is already rolled out. And in the next few weeks, we'll roll out the new structure for our FS team. So, we feel good with the leadership pool that we have within the company, who are moving up to take a broader role and a larger role, and that they will step up and deliver what we are driving to.	1159		2	 So, we feel good with the leadership pool that we have within the company, who are moving up to take a broader role and a larger role, and that they will step up and deliver what we are driving to.

What I can share is, we see through this past financial year, we have had a good, large deals booking, $9.8 bn with 40% net new and we see a set of very strong active relationships, some of them are expanding through the year through other work. And then we saw in Q4 during the quarter, some ramp downs. So, keeping those factors in mind, we have built the guidance of 4% to 7%.

1505	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  Yes, so I think firstly, the majority of the decline is volume-led. The balance of the revenue is one-timers which is a combination of specific client issues including the impact of cancellations as well, which is just a top line impact, more and more over and above the volume impact. So that is the state of play, really for the quarter. Ankur Rudra Okay thank you. On the guidance, I just wanted to get a sense, looking at what happened in the quarter and the uncertainty in the environment, are you turning more conservative for the guidance setting process for FY24 both on the revenues and the margins versus what you may have done before? And also along with that, if you can share what is the visibility that you have at the moment for the full year versus what you may have had at the beginning of last year?	819		0	Yes, so I think firstly, the majority of the decline is volume-led.

1506	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 So there on the guidance, we took into account what we see typically as we close the year in March on what we have had in new large deals and overall new deals. And the ongoing work that we have across our client base. And that basically becomes the foundation of our guidance. Typically, again, as you know well, we don't have a detailed view of Q3 and Q4. So, we have more typically estimates from other years that we use. And that is the same approach we have used this year from what we see as we look out. And the same on margin we finished the year at 21%.Utilization in Q4 is low compared to what we want to target. We have a very strong efficiency and cost program but within that program we are very clear that from an employee perspective we will continue with our commitment with employees. And so, the utilization will go up through the quarters but in the medium term, we will get that impact back into the margin and that is how we build the ‘20 to ‘22 margin guidance. Ankur Rudra Understood. Just a last question on the leadership, I think this was attempted before, clearly there has been departures as you know/ acknowledge. And some of them have gone to competition, probably will drive hungrier peers going forward. Do you think you are losing muscle and increasing the roles and responsibilities at a more concentrated leadership team? At least I've seen this from the outside, at a time when the industry is facing a tougher period this year? 	1466		1	 And the ongoing work that we have across our client base.

On delivery, many of them have now stepped up. And clearly any role as you start to step up to delivery and leadership within a large company like Infosys becomes more concentrated. And that has been announced and rolled out and the same will happen with FS where we are rolling that out in the coming weeks. FS segment of course, is a large segment for us. So those will be concentrated in that sense. So we will have a leadership structure with a very strong responsibility for several of the senior leaders. Ankur Rudra Understood.

I'm not sure I would say it is front or back but it is based on what we see in the large deals today. And also, in the pipeline that we have, where we do have some mega deals in the pipeline. So, that gives some weightage to the guidance given where those deals will come in the, later on in the year itself. The second one, sorry, Kawal was, are we more conservative?

You know every company would you know I mean want to operate at a certain base level of profitability. Now in Infosys’s case, this profitability has been drifting down and the profitability guidance is down to 20% to 22%, which is a new low. How should one think about the underlying operating assumptions behind these deal wins you know, and the process of bidding for large deals? And how does that tail in now with the underlying base of profitability aspirations and rather assumption that you have?

1514	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Hi, Kawal. Yes, so I think if you step back a bit into the last year and a half, I mean, basically the whole chasing of this demand side, three compensation hikes in 15 months, stretch salaries- all that in a way has made our structure bit inefficient. And in a way, part of that today is the reverse that you are sitting with 80% utilization whereas  you want to be at much higher levels and the pyramid is not as efficient because you had to get talent from anywhere when the market was hot. So, we have seen a lot of these sort of things during this period where we can identify these pockets sub-con  rising to 11.5%. So, we were clear that we had to go behind getting the volumes in and we knew we had time to correct the margin structure. And therefore, that is fundamentally what we still believe in. Our guidance is just today at a midpoint at the end of the year at 21%. And we have enough flexibility guidance in this between 20% to 22% and in-a-way 21% is just a midpoint of that. To take care of firstly of course there may be some headwinds coming because of compensation, there could be something on travel. But at the same time you have levers of improving our utilization at 80%, really which is probably on the lowest I have seen. We have other opportunities of improving the pyramid, because the higher bench comes with a double whammy of course. One is you have the ideal cost of the bench and at the same time you have a very rich pyramid. So the moment you start moving freshers into the pyramids, you get a double benefit of cost that, the idle cost goes away from the bench and your quality of the pyramid improves on the production side. So you are sitting on in fact two inefficiencies now. These are the levers we start using, pricing etc, still going on, maybe conversations, how we built in COLA (cost of living adjustments). So, our aspiration continues to be that we continue to look at improving margins from where we are. The guidance is just a reflection of the flexibility in this uncertain year and we have ended at 21% as you saw consistently during the last year as well.	2109		2	 The guidance is just a reflection of the flexibility in this uncertain year and we have ended at 21% as you saw consistently during the last year as well.  These are the levers we start using, pricing etc, still going on, maybe conversations, how we built in COLA (cost of living adjustments).

So the moment you start moving freshers into the pyramids, you get a double benefit of cost that, the idle cost goes away from the bench and your quality of the pyramid improves on the production side. Yes, so I think if you step back a bit into the last year and a half, I mean, basically the whole chasing of this demand side, three compensation hikes in 15 months, stretch salaries- all that in a way has made our structure bit inefficient.  And in a way, part of that today is the reverse that you are sitting with 80% utilization whereas  you want to be at much higher levels and the pyramid is not as efficient because you had to get talent from anywhere when the market was hot.	decline drop increase underperformed happened there wrong grow changed clear invest here broken show money statement spend opportunities good said improve comments fallen right correct yes adjustments progress contribute not changes outperformed unclear positive history over	behind acquisitions complete drop increase decline missing underperformed there wrong fall statements mistake changed done reference here guidance ticker clear invest removed release show website dead confidential capacity sense money reported improving statement formed today improvements continue figures spend orders opportunities good benefit saying said improve comments fallen right correct yes adjustments progress contribute bearish flexibility below grow comment not changes unclear positive history over

So, for instance you have fresher, how fast can you deploy them, when you are growing at 4% is at a different pace versus what you were deploying at 7% versus what you were deploying at 10%. So, all that will still weigh into the structure. It is not that you can immediately say, I'm going to overnight change my utilization from 80% to 85% or shift the onsite offshore because in a way a slower volume regime has that overhang on how fast can we deploy. But like I said, when we started, that we are sitting on these inefficiencies which are very visible to us. And we know we can deploy many of these levers which we have to continue to aspire for higher margin profiles.	907		1	 It is not that you can immediately say, I'm going to overnight change my utilization from 80% to 85% or shift the onsite offshore because in a way a slower volume regime has that overhang on how fast can we deploy.

If I look at your fiscal '23, you entered the year with a net new deal win of roughly $3.8 bn, which generated incremental revenues of $1.9 bn. You are entering fiscal '24 with a net new deal wins of $3.9 bn, which is pretty similar to last year, but the guidance implies incremental revenues of $1 bn at the midpoint.

And if you are seeing in FY '23, I think the last quarter, for instance somebody has also mentioned has been a weaker quarter because there is usually a four to six-month gap between that deal win right before it comes into revenue.

1556	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Sudheer Guntupalli 	 Hi good evening, thanks for the opportunity. A couple of clarifications. Due to unplanned ramp-downs and cancellations, you said we have seen a sharp 3.2% fall in the revenue. However, margins fell just 50 basis points. And even based on the positioning of margins you gave, utilization and cancellation led impact isn't so much in proportion to 3.2% fall in revenue. Logically, this decline of this magnitude should have entailed a much bigger margin impact, given the cost recalibration is difficult in the near term. So just curious, is there any sizable pass-through element which would have gotten rolled off, which would have also led to the revenue decline?

1558	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Sudheer Guntupalli 	 Sure. And the second part, the reason why I'm also asking about this pass-through component is the SVB scare and the sentiment overhang sort of unfolded from 10th March, post which there were 12 to 15 working days. And the revenue was almost 3.5% to 4% short of guidance or expectations, which means there is a $180 mn revenue swing. It looks quite a bit for 12 to 15 working days of invoicing, so again to put it  conversely, is there a deferred revenue component, which can come in the subsequent quarters since you also mentioned somewhere about the provision reversal or one off?	584		0	 And the revenue was almost 3. 5% to 4% short of guidance or expectations, which means there is a $180 mn revenue swing.

But how do you really think about medium-term margins, right? So the common question we have been getting from investors, given the direction of margins is can it be 18% a couple of years down the line. So, I know you can't quantify it, but just wanted to understand how you guys think about medium-term margins?	471		1	Surendra Goyal And second question is on margins for Nilanjan.

1566	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 We have explained it earlier in the question to Kawal as well. If you have to step back and you see during this period of COVID, for us to go after in a very talent constrained environment, the impact on the cost structure of the company all across- per capita cost went up, with a combination of compensation stretches, pyramids got skewed, basically, fundamentally, you were going behind these large deals. We don’t have time to really optimize on all these levers, subcon at a record 11.3%. All these inefficiencies we saw, but like we have continuously said during that period that we knew that we had to go and grab that volume, and we would have enough time to subsequently as we start unwinding those inefficiencies and this is a cost optimization program we run throughout That is where we still think these inefficiency still exists across- utilization is a classic one, we're sitting today at 80%, as we mentioned and it is got a double whammy on cost, like I mentioned earlier. So, these are things we will continue to target on and aspire to improve our margins, and 20% to 22% really gives us that flexibility and 21% just happens to be the midpoint where we ended the year. Surendra Goyal Sure, I get the annual guidance. My question was more medium-term because in good demand scenario, margins go down because of supply side issues and in bad demand scenario, possibly, they go down because of either pricing or whatever other reasons. So maybe, I'll just take it offline. Moderator Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital.	1580		2	 All these inefficiencies we saw, but like we have continuously said during that period that we knew that we had to go and grab that volume, and we would have enough time to subsequently as we start unwinding those inefficiencies and this is a cost optimization program we run throughout That is where we still think these inefficiency still exists across- utilization is a classic one, we're sitting today at 80%, as we mentioned and it is got a double whammy on cost, like I mentioned earlier.

But if you think about the guidance that you provided- on the one side, perhaps I would think that you give COLA benefits associated with your contracts, but a lot of your customers, frankly, are experiencing the same economic weakness you are and therefore, could negotiate can tougher pricing as we look out over the next 12 months.

1572	\infosys\mar-23.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 If you see pricing in generic, and I won't say how much of the pricing element has been built in. So, this is a program we started about a year and half back. And it is a combination of two or three things. One is the renewal discounts, which clients come back when programs are ending. And basically, after productivity increases at the  renewal stage, which we are just loosely calling discounts. That is something which we have really curved over the last few years, basically pushing back on the renewal because there are other ways we can get productivity as well. So that is something which has actually stemmed quite a lot. In fact, clients understand that we have to also provide for our own talent and in this hot talent market to compensate their teams. So that is something which we have learned appreciate as well. So that is one part of it. Second, is the program, which we run on digital pricing where we're going after new digital deals and this is a combination of how we have changed our pricing model into linking it, for instance, the new early acquired subsidiaries which have higher pricing, it could be more broad-based pricing, outcome-based pricing. There are new innovative pricing construct, so that is second. Third is simple hygiene work of having COLA clauses into our MSAs. And of course, how much you can execute and implement is a different question, but at least with that and deals going in, at least you have a starting point to negotiate with the client as well. So it is all three we look at in terms of existing deals, new deals and renewals and of course, you have clients where we are able to push this through great levels, some clients ask for that to be ploughed back into the employee sets. Some clients, it depends on markets, of course, who are going through their own sort of concerns on their environment, it may be more difficult. And therefore, it is literally horses for courses in which we go literally client by client to see where we can get an improvement in the underlying RPP realization.	2046		1	 Third is simple hygiene work of having COLA clauses into our MSAs.

1590	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Rishi. Good afternoon. Thank you all for joining us today. I trust each of you and your families are safe and well. It is wonderful to be back on our campus and also to be with Pravin and Nilanjan in person after five quarters, of course at a safe social distance. I am delighted to share with you, that we have had a landmark first quarter with robust YoY growth of 16.9% and sequential growth of 4.8% in constant currency terms. This is the fastest growth we have seen in 10 years. We continue to gain significant market share with this growth being essentially organic and especially in the area of digital transformation. This is a clear reflection of Infosys’ resilience and client relevance that has grown stronger with the unwavering commitments of our employees and our differentiated digital portfolio. I would like to thank all our employees for their incredible dedication especially during another testing period with the second COVID wave in India. Some of the highlights of our results are: 1. Our Digital business grew by 42% YoY and now constitutes 53.9% of our revenues. 2. We had broad-based growth across all our sectors, service lines and geographies. Financial Services grew by 23%, Retail 22%, Life Sciences 21%, and Manufacturing 19%, the North America geography by 21%. 3. Our large deals were at $2.6 bn, large deals are deals over $50mn in value. 4. Operating margins were strong at 23.7%. 5. We had tremendous focus on our employees especially related to their well-being and to new talent expansion. We had a net headcount increase of 8,000 attracting leading talent from the market. We remain comfortable with our ability to support our clients in their digital transformation journey. With a strong start to the financial year, good large deals in Q1, strong pipeline, we are increasing our annual revenue guidance for growth from 12% to 14% moving up to 14% to 16% in constant currency. Our operating margin guidance remains unchanged at 22% to 24%. Let me pause here and hand it back to Rishi and then let us open it up for questions.	2074		2	 This is a clear reflection of Infosys’ resilience and client relevance that has grown stronger with the unwavering commitments of our employees and our differentiated digital portfolio. 9% of our revenues.

1592	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Mugdha Variyar 	 Hi Salil, Nilanjan, Pravin. Congrats on a very strong quarter. What a start to the fiscal year, your strongest growth in Q1 in a decade and Salil, let me come to you then. Is it the growth in Q1 that has given you the confidence to increase your revenue guidance and that too much higher than what a lot of the street was expecting and if you can tell us a little bit about your deal wins, the pricing that you are seeing now in the market and the tenure? And while your digital growth has been really strong, the core business seems to have degrown YoY. If you can tell us what is the weakness there in the core business? Nilanjan, let me come to the point about margins with you. If you can tell us what was the margin pressure which led the margins to be lower than what the street was estimating and going forward as well, you have called out a few headwinds when it comes to margins, if you can elaborate on that especially around talent retention, etc. And Nilanjan, a specific question about the India business because we did see that TCS had called out the impact from the India business. For Infosys the India revenue share is about 3%, I think, it has come down to 2.9% in this quarter. Did you see any impact of the second wave as part of your India business? Pravin, again on attrition, you did say that you will be hiring a lot of freshers etc., but when do we see the next salary hike, what will be the quantum of the salary hike and if you can just throw some light on the challenges you are facing now in terms of the supply side, given that you are seeing strong demand. And Pravin, of course lastly, I have to ask you about the income tax website issue, if it has been completely resolved, because the Finance Minister was in Bengaluru just two weeks ago, and she said, a few issues were still unresolved, if you can throw some light on that? Thank you.	1872		0	 If you can tell us what was the margin pressure which led the margins to be lower than what the street was estimating and going forward as well, you have called out a few headwinds when it comes to margins, if you can elaborate on that especially around talent retention, etc.  Did you see any impact of the second wave as part of your India business.

For Infosys the India revenue share is about 3%, I think, it has come down to 2.	acquisitions decline increase underperformed there fall grow changed clear invest here increasing dead confidential statement mixed good benefit saying said comments data right correct yes margins progress contribute growing struggled comment down numbers unclear positive over	behind acquisitions decline increase answered underperformed there fall mistake changed done clear grow here invest ticker removed remarks increasing nothing strength reported statement figures coming problems mixed grown good benefit saying said comments weakness growth right correct rise yes margins progress contribute growing struggled numbers comment not changes unclear positive closed over
1593	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Mugdha for the questions. Let me start off. I think in terms of what we see in the market, the growth of course was very strong in the first quarter as you noted, we also see a good pipeline from where we are working with clients. We see that the digital transformation approach that our clients are looking for is something that we can support them with quite well and we also saw a good large deals numbers and wins in Q1. When you put all of that together, that gave us the confidence to increase our revenue growth guidance at the end of the first quarter. In terms of the pricing that you mentioned, we see the pricing to be reasonably stable. We do not see any real constraints in it at this stage or any differences from what we have seen in the past. Let me now pass it to Nilanjan.	799		2	 We see that the digital transformation approach that our clients are looking for is something that we can support them with quite well and we also saw a good large deals numbers and wins in Q1.

1594	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 So, the first question, Mugdha you had on margins, as you know, that last year we ended at 24.5%, and we had called out that there were a lot of one-off benefits we had received during the year. Some of them were discretionary in nature, like travel came off, facilities and other discretionary spends have been cut down and of course some expenses were deferred, things like salary hikes and promotions etc., and therefore when we called out our guidance for FY22 we had actually factored all that in and said it is going to be 22% to 24% versus a 24.5% of last year. Please keep in mind also the pre-pandemic sort of guidance was 21% to 23% so this was a step up as well from a guidance operating range and in 23.7% we are at the top end of that guidance. Having said that on a sequential basis, if you’ve seen, our margins are down from 24.5% to 23.7%, out of that we have got about a 10 basis points benefit of currency, we have got about 40 basis points benefit of utilization and this was offset by about 50 basis points of subcontractor and third party costs as demand has really ramped up and we have taken up subcontractor to fulfill the demand, and about balance 80 basis points is a combination of various employee-related costs whether it is retention, hiring, promotions, etc. So that is the broad margin walk on a sequential   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 5 basis. We remain very, very confident in our 22% to 24%, band, we have a lot of operating levers on taking out costs, so that is a comfort zone for us. Your second question on India as mentioned, yes, India is a very, very small portion for us and I think both from a demand and a supply side, we have not seen any impact. I must call out the fantastic and dedicated work done by all the employees across the globe to ensuring that we are able to fulfill our demand during these trying times as well. In that sense India really didn’t impact us. Over to you Pravin!	1950		0	7%, out of that we have got about a 10 basis points benefit of currency, we have got about 40 basis points benefit of utilization and this was offset by about 50 basis points of subcontractor and third party costs as demand has really ramped up and we have taken up subcontractor to fulfill the demand, and about balance 80 basis points is a combination of various employee-related costs whether it is retention, hiring, promotions, etc. So, the first question, Mugdha you had on margins, as you know, that last year we ended at 24. 5% to 23. 5%, and we had called out that there were a lot of one-off benefits we had received during the year.

1595	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 Thanks, Nilanjan. Your first question was on attrition. Attrition for IT services that is voluntary attrition on an LTM basis has increased to 13.9%, it was 10.9% earlier. In some sense it is an area of concern, but at the same time, it is also a reflection of high demand environment out there, and shortage of supply. We expect this situation to continue for a couple of quarters till supply catches up. From our own perspective, as Salil mentioned, we have been able to backfill attrition as well as we had a net hiring of 8,000 this quarter. It is a clear reflection of the kind of brand that we have and the ability to attract the right talent. We will continue to focus on that. We have increased our campus hiring or the fresher hiring to 35,000 globally. We have already recruited more than 10,000 in this quarter, and we are also doing several other interventions. We already had one compensation increase in January and the second one is effective July we will be rolling it out. We have increased the number of promotions. There is a significant focus on retention there is lot of employee engagement initiatives, lot of focus on career growth, career opportunities for people and so on. So, this is something we will continue to do so and hopefully, over the next couple of quarters we should be able to come to terms with high attrition. Your second question was on the income tax project. We are working hard to address all the issues raised with respect to the portal. Many of the issues raised around performance and stability have been addressed. With the result today, on an average we have 8-10 lakh people signing on to the portal and doing various activities. Many of the new functionalities like e- proceedings, TDS returns, some of the statutory forms and ITR, too, have been released. Today, we have about 10 lakhs ITRs filed so far. Yesterday, we had about 1 lakh ITRs filed in a single day. We have about 1.6 lakhs DSP registrations, we have close to 2 lakhs statutory forms filed, we had 31,000 e-proceedings response submitted. We have been able to address about 63.5 lakhs Aadhar-Pan linking requests and so on. So, as you can see, we have made some progress, but having said that we still have some ways to go. We have to address some of the intermittent issues we continue to face in some of the functionalities that are available. At the same time, we also have to rollout new functionalities as well. We are working very collaboratively with the Income Tax Department as well as other stakeholders. And it is our endeavor to address all these issues as expeditiously as possible. We have also added more bandwidth, we have invested in much more leadership, and I want to assure that this is the single largest priority for us today and we are hopeful to address the remaining concerns as well, as we roll out the remaining functionalities in due course.	2887		2	 With the result today, on an average we have 8-10 lakh people signing on to the portal and doing various activities. 6 lakhs DSP registrations, we have close to 2 lakhs statutory forms filed, we had 31,000 e-proceedings response submitted.

Salil, the deal momentum has been fairly strong, what is the kind of nature of deals that you have seen during the quarter, give us more color on that? Are there more large and small deals and also what is the kind of momentum that you have seen across the verticals and geographies in terms of the deal momentum? Secondly, talk to us more about the   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 6 opportunities that you are seeing on the M&A front. Pravin, my question to you is that Infosys has retained a 22% -24% margin band and you did mention that you have a good amount of margin levers there and hence the confidence on the margin front despite several headwinds. So, what are those operating levers that you have in terms of margin defence. And one more question to Salil is, what is the kind of market share gains that you have seen so far and what is the outlook ahead on the market share gains for you?	1034		2	 Secondly, talk to us more about the   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 6 opportunities that you are seeing on the M&A front.

1598	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Poonam. I think starting off first with the discussion on the deals, it is a mix of deals in our large deals portfolio with mid-size and larger deals. We see a good pipeline, we see good ability to convert. The type of work really comes from areas which are focused on data and analytics, a lot of work in the cloud side and there is also more and more work that we are seeing, which is a core functionality, a core set of actions, and converting, modernizing them into much more digital capabilities. In terms of the sectors, we are seeing a good traction from the growth numbers across several of our sectors, in fact, all of our sectors have grown very nicely. But there is good deal pipeline also in what we see in financial services, in retail, in manufacturing, in life sciences, so those are sectors, utilities, where we see a good deal pipeline as well. Before Pravin takes the other question, I will come back to the third one. On M&A our thinking is quite similar to what we have shared in the past- which is, first our focus is to look at things which help us accelerate what we are doing in digital. That is what our clients are looking for. Digital comprises of all of the elements, the Cloud, the IoT, the Cybersecurity, the data and so on, so those are areas we continue to look for and since there is a fit in terms of culture, there is a fit in terms of what we think we can do with the integration and then there is a fit in terms of how the value gets aligned. So those are really the same parameters and approach that we continue to look for in acquisitions. Pravin over to you.	1606		2	 On M&A our thinking is quite similar to what we have shared in the past- which is, first our focus is to look at things which help us accelerate what we are doing in digital.

1599	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 On the margin levers, we have several levers. First one is driving higher efficiencies through adoption of lean and automation. This is something we have been doing for the last two years and there is still much more runway there. The second one is in the area of pyramid, role ratios and pyramid organization. Again, there are huge opportunities still left there. Third area is in pricing, particularly in the digital side, so that is an opportunity for us to drive higher pricing. These are in my mind some of the critical things. Right now, there are other levers which are probably optimized like typically utilization is a lever, but we are already highly optimized there, so there is not much scope in the short-term. Likewise, onsite-offshore ratio is also highly optimized, but three or four other levers which I talked about are some of the levers that are available for us to drive higher margins and we are extremely comfortable with the guidance of 22% to 24%.	973		2	 This is something we have been doing for the last two years and there is still much more runway there.

1602	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thank you, Sharad. We very much see the demand which is focused on digital and cloud areas. Digital, itself grew at 42%. We also have our Infosys Cobalt set of capabilities, which has seen more and more traction with our clients, and we continue to expand that set of capabilities, we continue to build out more industry specific solutions and more artifacts which are being used by our clients as they look at their cloud journeys. Those are areas which are most in demand. The other side that we see - where there is a focus on operations and technology coming together and doing a complete transformation from a client’s business perspective and that is driving how it impacts their end customers or their employees or how they interact with their partner ecosystem. Those are places where we are seeing more and more traction. So overall the demand outlook looks quite good, and the pricing looks quite stable at the start of this financial year. Pravin, over to you.	972		2	 The other side that we see - where there is a focus on operations and technology coming together and doing a complete transformation from a client’s business perspective and that is driving how it impacts their end customers or their employees or how they interact with their partner ecosystem.

We also announced the second round of increments which will be effective July of this year, so that is already underway. That is the compensation plan, and it is already factored in our margin guidance. Likewise, any increased travel due to relaxation on the COVID guidelines and so on, all those things have already been factored in from a margin perspective. In terms of hiring, we are looking at about 35,000 college-graduate hiring globally. We have already hired 10,000 this quarter and we will hire the remaining 25,000 over the next three quarters. We will continue to hire laterals as we have been doing in the past in addition to the college graduate hiring.	764		1	On the compensation front, we did the first round of increments effective January of this year.

1605	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Sajeet Manghat 	 Good set of numbers from your end. Salil, my question to you, in FY21 we saw you gathering nearly $14 bn of deal and $2.6 bn in Q1 of this year. Can you give us an idea of where is this deal coming from? Which regions this is coming from and what is the kind of pricing pressure that you may be facing here. Because even though deals are coming in at a much higher rates, we are not able to see that translate into higher margins and your margins are dependent on your domestic levers and efficiency levers, which are there, that is one question? For Nilanjan, you spoke the fact that you have wage hikes coming in. Can you give us an idea of when the discretionary spends with respect to travel and marketing expenses is kicking and if that kicks in, by what quarter we could see that impact coming into the EBIT margins going forward? For Pravin, a sense of some of the verticals how they are doing – BFSI, retail, and communication, are we seeing large deals coming in from there or is this just discretionary spends which is coming in from some of the clients?	1065		1	Salil, my question to you, in FY21 we saw you gathering nearly $14 bn of deal and $2.

1606	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for those questions. I will start off. I think what we see with the large deals as you shared, we had a good outcome last financial year at $14 bn, this quarter it is starting off well at $2.6 bn.   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 8 We definitely see these deals being very much part of the change that our clients are looking for and that is what from our portfolio of services that the clients are leveraging. As I shared earlier, our pricing looks stable at this stage, in terms of how that translates to margin as Nilanjan was sharing, last year we had several one-offs where travel had come down where we had been extremely focused on many other costs as we entered the March, April, May timeframe. Many of those costs will start going up, for example, the salary increases and many other things we have done for the employees. As that has come in, that is where we see the outcome of 23.7% in the first quarter. We still see from a deal perspective a good outlook and this 23.7% is very much within the guidance that we had shared at the beginning of the year, and we continue to have confidence that we are in that guidance. With that let me pass it on to you, Pravin.	1192		2	7% is very much within the guidance that we had shared at the beginning of the year, and we continue to have confidence that we are in that guidance. 6 bn.

1607	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 From an industry perspective, we have had a broad based growth. Seven of the eight industry verticals had double digit growth except communication and two of our largest verticals FS and retail had more than 20% YoY growth on constant currency basis. And if you look at from large deal perspective, we had 22 large deal wins this quarter, out of it, nine were in Financial Services, four each in Retail and Energy, Utility, Resources & Services, two in Manufacturing and one each in other verticals. So Financial Services obviously had standout growth this quarter and this is consistent with what we have seen in the past four to five quarters we have had industry leading growth. Growth has been led primarily in US and mostly in the subsegments of banking, mortgages, wealth, and retirement services. With economy opening up, we expect demand to come back in the payment space as well. We are seeing a lot of uptick on cloud adoption, and we are seeing lot of opportunities around cloud migration, cloud management, cloud platform implementations and so on. We are well positioned as the full-scale digital transformation player in this space. We have also seen good uptick in demand in retail after a long time. With vaccination done and economy opening up in many of the major markets, we are seeing pent up demand coming to the fore. Consumers’ sentiment is turning positive. This augurs well for the retail sector. Clients are aggressively investing in accelerating their digital transformation initiatives. It is a great opportunity for us to help our clients in their omnichannel initiatives and compete with the digital initiatives. We are seeing good traction in this space as well. While CMT has been soft on a YoY basis, on a sequential basis we are seeing good growth on the back of some of the large deal wins both in prior quarter and in the current quarter. In this space, there is a lot of focus on 5G, cybersecurity, edge computing, and some of the next gen technologies like IoT, AI and so on. Energy, Utilities, was one of the softer quarters and we still see some softness in travel, hospitality, and also in energy space. However, we are slowly seeing some discretionary spend come back in this space. Here the focus is more on customer service transformation, legacy modernization, smart grid initiatives and so on. Lastly, on the manufacturing, again we have had industry leading growth. We have had a tailwind of Daimler win in the previous quarter. We are doing extremely well in all the three subsegments of aerospace, automotive and industrial. Here I think we are seeing a lot of opportunities around ER&D, engineering, industrial IoT and so on. So net-net, the growth has been pretty much broad based.

1609	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Kushal Gupta 	 My first question is to Mr. Parekh with regards to the digital revenue which we are having. It has gone almost to 54%, so currently like in terms of the market demand which is coming up, is it more about reaching may be Accenture level because going forward I think it would more be around digital, particular contracts which we are getting in terms of deals. I wanted to get clarity on that. Secondly to Mr. Rao, I would want to ask with vaccination now happening and people coming back to office, what is the percentage are we looking at going forward permanently as the hybrid model?

My first question is to Mr.  It has gone almost to 54%, so currently like in terms of the market demand which is coming up, is it more about reaching may be Accenture level because going forward I think it would more be around digital, particular contracts which we are getting in terms of deals.	behind acquisitions complete participate increase neutral missing answered there fall statements changed clear invest reference here grow ticker removed interested release gone confidential reported name statement figures coming orders good saying said comments data now correct yes progress contribute below comment unclear positive over	acquisitions selling increase there fall grow changed clear invest remarks increasing ask gone confidential spend good follow saying said comments data now right correct yes progress contribute comment not changes unclear positive over
1610	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your questions. I think on the first one with respect to digital, what we are seeing is that with all of the capabilities that we have built, one of the examples, we discussed earlier was on Infosys Cobalt on cloud. There are many others including on what we have done with artificial intelligence, what we are doing on machine learning, where we have strengths in data and analytics. We have today across the board a leading position in 48 categories that are tracked in the digital spectrum by independent market analysts. And that gives our clients the confidence to work with Infosys and to select Infosys for their most critical digital transformation programs. Where will this go, I think at this stage we are happy with the growth of 42%, the overall percentage having become 54% and we think this will continue because the client demand is very strong for digital. Now what we have in terms of capabilities, there is high level of relevance what our clients are looking for and we are building out the capacity in terms of all of our employees working for these areas. Our reskilling is going on to support these areas. So, from that perspective, we see a good future for the digital growth. Pravin, over to you.	1232		2	 And that gives our clients the confidence to work with Infosys and to select Infosys for their most critical digital transformation programs.

1611	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 In terms of work-from-office, today we have about 98% of employees working from home globally. In India it is much higher at 99%. In terms of vaccination as well, in India we have about close to 58% of our employees who have had at least one dose of vaccination. About 10% of the people have had both the doses, but in some of the markets like Europe and US and all, we have had a higher percentage of people getting vaccinated and we are slowly seeing the economy open up. So, we do expect in the course of this quarter some amount of increased number of people coming to office to work. So one thing is certain, that future will be hybrid, where people will have flexibility to work-from-home or work-from-office. It will depend on the people inclination, it will depend on the clients requirement and it will also depend on the nature of the product. From our perspective, we are very well equipped. In the past, we have demonstrated our ability to switch between work-from-office and work-from-home seamlessly, so we are pretty confident that we should be able to deal with this situation. It is very difficult to figure out what percentage of people would like to work-from-office or work-from-home, but only time will tell. Our efforts over the next couple of quarters will be to slowly start getting more and more people to come to office, even though it could be in a hybrid model.

Mr Parekh you did mention about the fact that this is perhaps the fastest growth in the last one decade. You have also increased the guidance as well, so just wanted to know whether this kind of growth is maintainable, given the fact that especially Europe and US offices have started reopening, pandemic has to a great extent retreated in several countries in Europe and US, do you think that this growth is maintainable?	575		0	 Mr Parekh you did mention about the fact that this is perhaps the fastest growth in the last one decade.

1613	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 There, the way we see it is today, the overall demand outlook as we engage with clients is very strong. To give you an example, I was in a discussion two weeks ago with a client where they are asking us to expand the work we do with them in a material way across a variety of their programs, some of them on Digital and others on other technologies. These are sorts of discussions, me, our colleagues, who are interacting with clients are having. So we feel comfortable with the economy coming back in many of the western markets that this will continue. Of course, what we have done with the guidance is for this financial year and that is the outlook that we share with the overall change or the digital transformation that many industries are going through is quite remarkable. Many companies, which were not in the digital space, not in the online space are now shifting at a rapid speed and those are areas  where we can help and support them. Many companies that were native digital companies are also growing very fast where we can help and support them. So, from all of those perspectives today the demand looks very good.

1615	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Chandra Ranganathan 	 Hi Salil, Pravin Nilanjan, questions for all of you. Salil, to begin with a lot of companies are talking about how the nature of contracts itself is changing. It is becoming larger, more transformative and they are now going back to the same plans getting renewals, they are getting bigger ticket size contracts and for longer durations? If you can weigh in on that? Secondly, I would also like your take on the series of internet IPOs that we are seeing in India, what you make of this new wave of wealth creation because Infosys has really been the gold standard when it comes to wealth creation for retail investors.  Pravin, a couple of questions. You gave an update on vaccination. When we spoke to you in July you had mentioned 11,000 people were vaccinated? You will place an order for 1.2 mn doses to cover all employees and their dependents. So, can you give us a sense of whether you are getting the supply? How much till date? Also, in terms of attrition, have you changed it from annualized to LTM because the number for March is different compared to what you said last time so again can you take us through why you have sort of decided to do this? One last question on ITR.You mentioned that you know it is work-in-progress but why does Infosys struggle with government projects in general in India? Is it because the scope keeps changing for   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 11 these projects because we have seen this in the past with MCA 21 and GST also.

1616	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Chandra. Let me start off there. I think in terms of the type of deals that are going on with our clients are broadly across what we see in the market. We do not see that there is a change whether it is duration or the terms of going back to the same client to extend. Our approach is much more looking at what is the objective our clients are driving and what is the impact that we can have in helping them achieve that objective. So deals are of different sizes and different durations and we have not seen a shift if I look back over the last 24 to 36 months. Of course, during the very first days when COVID started off there was a change in what people were looking at. There was a lot more focus on cost efficiency, but as we progressed through this, there is an increased focus on digital transformation and those are the sorts of deals that we are seeing today. With that let me pass it on to Pravin.	916		1	I think in terms of the type of deals that are going on with our clients are broadly across what we see in the market.

1619	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 Chandra, on the vaccination front so far we have administered over 230,000 doses. About 120,000 plus employees have been covered. The remaining are the dependents. So this translates to about 59% of our employees having at least one single dose and about 10% of the employees having both the doses. We have already placed order for more than half a million doses. But today the issue is not about supply at least from our perspective, our issue has been about roughly 50% of our people are no longer in the cities where our DCs are. Their homes are in tier two and tier three cities and while we have tie ups with hospitals to administer vaccines for those people wherever they are required, they are also relying on vaccine available in their own regions and they are trying to get vaccinated. So from our perspective, we have not seen too much of issue with the supply. Our challenge has been how do you ensure 50% of our people who are in tier two and tier three cities get themselves vaccinated because they are dispersed across multiple cities and that is where our focus is on currently. On the attrition front, earlier we used to do quarterly annualized. Now we have moved to last 12 month basis. So the numbers I gave are comparing relative to the last 12 months basis. This is the voluntary attrition for IT services. Last quarter, it was 10.9% and this quarter it has moved up to 13.9%. The reason we have shifted is when we look at all our peers, the majority of them are using LTM criteria so we thought it is good for us to also align with what seems to be the common standard in the industry. On income tax, our focus is right now on trying to address the issues, fix it expeditiously. We have not really done a post-mortem. There will be time for us to do it much later so right now our focus is on that so at some point in time we have to really test out and figure out what happened and what can we do differently. As we have repeatedly said we are really proud of all these stuff that we do for India project and the kind of work that we do. It is not a question of not wanting to do, we   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 12 are indeed open to do that and we want to do it, but we definitely need to look at what when wrong here and try to address it in the future.	2293		1	 We have already placed order for more than half a million doses.

1622	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for your question. I think on the first one, we are seeing both on a sequential basis and on a YoY basis. This growth is the fastest we have had in over a decade, so we are extremely delighted that, that is the way our clients are perceiving us. On what some of the banks are doing as we shared in terms of setting up their centers, what we see is there is a tremendous amount of demand and especially in the banking sector but in several other sectors where also centers are set up, for example, retail, or Hi-Tech and there are projects which are done by those centers. In several cases, we actually are collaborating with the centers as they are scaling up to make sure that we support bank or retail company or others both in the western geographies as well as in India. So, today, we do not see that that is something that is taking away from the work that we are doing. There is a large amount of work that we still see that is coming straight from many of our clients and many of the projects that we do when we have centers, we collaborate with them as well.	1074		2	I think on the first one, we are seeing both on a sequential basis and on a YoY basis.

Geography wise we had 14 in Americas, five in Europe, two in Rest of the World and one in India and 30% is net new out of this large deal win. The second one from a campus perspective as we said earlier, we are planning to recruit a total number of about 35,000 college graduates worldwide. Even in the past we have tried to look at accelerating the training duration and faster deployment for a specific set of college graduates. For instance, if someone has already been trained in computer science and if someone is a computer science graduate or someone has  advanced technology experience, in those cases we have a much condensed training schedule so that they can be deployed on projects in a much quicker way. But, for people graduating in some of the other disciplines, we continue to take about nearly three-and-a-half to four months to complete the training duration. We believe that is important to lay a very strong foundation and at the end of it, they become pretty much productive in the projects.	1210		1	In terms of large deals, we had as we said $2.

We see the economies opening up, through that we see a lot of demand for large programs which look at modernization, look at transformation, look at cloud or look at areas which are focused on data and analytics. We do see our large deals in all of these areas and especially when things have to be brought together where all of the capabilities have to work in conjunction, those are the sorts of deals where we have a real advantage where all of our thinking and approach of ‘One Infosys’ comes together. In terms of sectors, we see continuously good demand for those sorts of activities in Financial Services, Retail, consumer products has come back nicely. We see good demand on the Hi-Tech sector and that is an area which has tremendous potential going ahead. Many of the other sectors are also in   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 14 good shape, but these are especially quite strong at this time.

1629	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 I think the nature of the pandemic is, we will continue to see multiple waves because while India is expecting a third wave some of the geographies have already had the impact of the third wave and economies have started opening up. In the long run, getting majority of the population vaccinated and following safe practices at least for the near future is going to be the only solution. In the interim, the current way of working in hybrid model will probably remain true. So whatever we have been doing in the last four-five quarters in terms of hiring, working from home, those things still continue. In the past as well, between the first and second wave we had about 5% of the population come back to work, but when second wave triggered, we had most of them started working back from home, so we expect that trend to continue for some time. But our own expectation is over the next six months or so, assuming that the impact of any subsequent wave is minimal, we will probably expect maybe about 20% to 30% of the people to start coming to work- from-office. Again, this could vary from geography to geography and as I said earlier it will also depend on nature of project, client requirements, and individual preferences and so on.	1239		1	I think the nature of the pandemic is, we will continue to see multiple waves because while India is expecting a third wave some of the geographies have already had the impact of the third wave and economies have started opening up.

From our perspective, I do not know broadly about the sector, our own focus in that, is we are seeing that as those companies become more competitive, we will certainly benefit. In terms of data and protection, we are already very much supportive of the approach that various of our clients have taken within the insurance companies and the banks where this is a greatest impact. We feel we will be able to support them as they go through, some of the changes that may be required or that may come from this. But the details of this still are being worked out as you know and once they get worked out, we will get a sense of what the impact will be specifically for our clients and therefore how that will impact the changes that we have to do the work.

What are the reasons for optimism that you are seeing in particularly your major geography, the US as well as your major vertical, the BFSI segment?  The question for Pravin is about challenges that you are facing in skilling, hiring and retaining employees just as you see the whole startup ecosystem and the SaaS startup ecosystem, there is a lot of activity in all of these, and these are the brands that compete with you on hiring, how do you expect to see hiring turnout in the coming quarters? And the last question again to Pravin, is about employees’ reluctance to come back to office, have you seen that or have you seen indications of that?	737		1	My question to Salil is about the conversations that you are having with the clients.

1637	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 I think the first one, in my discussions especially with clients in Financial Services, there are different types of work that we are seeing. One is work that relates to the Financial Services companies looking to expand or get greater market share with their customer base. What we have learnt or what they have learnt through this last several quarters is when you leverage digital platforms and cloud, customer connect acquisition work becomes much more intuitive for their customers and we with our capabilities set on digital and cloud are able to support that. Another area that we see is focused on what clients in Financial Services want to do in terms of which specific partners they want to work with. We are seeing that with the extreme resilience that we have shown through the work-from-home move and even supporting clients through all of the changes in the past five, six quarters there is a tremendous benefit, and we see some discussions where we are getting more and more access to and work with some clients in Financial Services. The third area, there is a regulatory work that we see clients in Financial Services are doing and that requires more expansion and in many of those places, we are present. And the fourth is where the clients are looking to combine the operations and technology, transform the whole business, make it more efficient, but also much more digital and new age where they can engage with their employees or other customers in a more intuitive way and when that combines tech and ops again we find ourselves in the most strong position to support our clients because they see that we are able to bring everything together much more effectively as ‘One Infosys’. So, there are multiple areas in Financial Services and each sector has different aspects that we can see that help us to scale up. With that let me pass it to Pravin.	1873		2	 We are seeing that with the extreme resilience that we have shown through the work-from-home move and even supporting clients through all of the changes in the past five, six quarters there is a tremendous benefit, and we see some discussions where we are getting more and more access to and work with some clients in Financial Services.

1638	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 On the attrition front, you are right. It is a reflection of the strong demand environment and in addition to that, the startup is also very attractive place for many of our employees and with more and more of unicorns out there, that sector is now also an increasing focus for some of our employees. So obviously that is something we are dealing with. From our perspective, there is a two-pronged  approach - one is we are doing our best to retain people, we are trying to articulate the value proposition, the kind of investments we are doing in terms of their own career, in ensuring that they are digitally ready, future ready and so on, we are talking about the inclusive culture that we have in the organization and there are lot of other investments around employee in terms of job rotation, billing and so on, so those are some of the things we are trying to articulate and there is a lot of deep engagement and lot of focus on retaining employees. At the same time, we are also looking at attracting new talent as well. One of our biggest strengths has been our ability to recruit college graduates, train them and then deploy them in a productive manner and from that perspective we are one of the most attractive brands in the country and our ability to   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 16 attract this kind of talent is very high. Even this quarter with higher attrition we have not only been able to backfill attrition, but we have also had 8,000 of net hire. So, that is the reflection of our ability to also recruit talent, upscale, train them and deploy them and further, so that is the other area we will focus on. In terms of employee’s willingness to come back to work, in some sense you are right, there is some sense of hesitancy in terms of employees wanting to return to work. Primarily most of it is around safety concerns and so on and it also varies from geography to geography. One of the things, we have realized is where people are in the same city as where our campuses are located, there I think there is much more willingness for people to come. They are looking at some kind of flexibility rather than a big bang approach and which we are also trying to do in a phased manner, but our challenges mostly for people who are no longer in tier-1 cities where our campuses are, they have gone back to their home towns which will be in tier-2, tier-3 cities there, there is a greater deal of reluctance because they are not sure whether there will be an advent of third wave, whether they have to sit back to work-from-home and so on. So I think there is a bigger deal of reluctance from that set of population. Our own sense is this requires some amount of pain management and we have to do it in a very phased manner, so our approach is to first start small 8 to 12 weeks, encourage people who are willing to come on a voluntary basis and creating that safe environment and giving them assurance, creating trust between the employees that they have a safe environment to work on and based on that learning we will fine tune it and we are confident over the course of the next three to six months we should be able to address any concerns employees have and encourage them to come back to office as required depending on the nature of work.	3279		2	 One of our biggest strengths has been our ability to recruit college graduates, train them and then deploy them in a productive manner and from that perspective we are one of the most attractive brands in the country and our ability to   External Document © 2021 Infosys Limited 16 attract this kind of talent is very high.

1640	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks for the question. The way we are seeing today, first there were some constraints, as you rightly point out last year in the budget but that very quickly gave way to what you describe as the efficiency cost discussions, but there was also a discussion on what can we do to change our business in terms of becoming much more online, much more digital, much more connected, so that they could expand their own connects in the market. Today, what we are seeing is that both of those continue, there is a huge focus and through our work on automation and artificial intelligence we are at the forefront of helping our clients, be much more efficient with respect to the tech spend. There is also the focus on building out new capabilities on their side, which allow them to be more fluid in the digital online environment. Some of that is a cost, some of that is a spend for them but a lot of that is also becoming an investment for them. So, it is a different way that they are looking at technology and that is partially why we see some of the boost because once large companies look at technology also as an investment it is a completely different pool from which they are looking to do their investment and then the returns that they are looking on it in terms of market growth or business repositioning or efficiency, which is the outcome that they are getting. So those are the changes that we are seeing in the way the budgets are evolving.

1642	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Supriya Roy 	 Hi gentlemen. I want to know what fraction of the India business in this June quarter has been coming from the government sector in the country and if you could compare that to the June quarter the previous year. I understand the pricing is not quite affected by the volatility of the macroeconomic conditions right now, but how does the changing demands of the India clients that you have now and the kind of clients that you want to have in the near future who want to retain the pricing that you have in the India market, given again the whole backdrop of COVID-19 situation. The second question is - I want to revisit the problem statement on attrition Pravin did mention that as and when supply does catch up there will be better opportunities. So could you just elaborate on what supply catching up is he referring to there as well, and I also want to further define the problem statement with there are lot of these media reports which go onto show data that lot of these heavily backed startups in the country are paying good engineers to the tune of as much as over maybe Rs.1 Crore 11 lakhs per annum and then you have engineers with two to three years of experience earning as much as Rs.52 lakhs or Rs.53 lakhs at these heavily backed startups on per annum basis. So how is Infosys’ approach beyond fresher hiring going to capture this sort of talent pool that the startups are well positioned to train as well as go on to balance the same excellent operating margin that are currently sustaining?	1510		1	 I understand the pricing is not quite affected by the volatility of the macroeconomic conditions right now, but how does the changing demands of the India clients that you have now and the kind of clients that you want to have in the near future who want to retain the pricing that you have in the India market, given again the whole backdrop of COVID-19 situation.

1643	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Let me start off and then Pravin and Nilanjan may join in. On the India business what you mentioned, as you know, and Nilanjan was sharing earlier, India business is small part just under 3% of our revenue. We do not split out within that any of the sectors and what the percentage of that sector is, nor do we split out separately the pricing in that, suffice it to say what Nilanjan was sharing that we had a growth in all of our geographies including in our India geography in Q1. We of course, as all of us did, had an intense impact of the second wave and nonetheless our work there continued in many ways. In terms of attrition, let me start off and then of course Pravin will jump in. The thinking that we have there is we want to make sure that we do everything that we are doing, keeping employees in the forefront. Pravin mentioned number of different factors that we are looking at. Of course we have done a lot of work as Pravin and Nilanjan both mentioned- with the January increase in compensation with the one that kicks in, in July one with a lot of activity on promotions, all of those things are part of work we are driving with respect to making sure that we are an extremely attractive company for talent. Again, as Pravin mentioned, and I had shared earlier we had a net hiring of 8,000 people, so we continue to make sure that we fulfill the demand that we are seeing in front of us. In terms of what you said about the startups and some of the salary points, what we see today is that we have an extremely good training environment, what Pravin referenced earlier, three to four months, we also have a career path which is long with lots of interesting projects, and we are able to attract employees into that talent mix. Of course, we also are looking at what we are doing with compensation, we are also doing things which gives special bonuses where there are digital skills involved and we work with all of our employees to make sure that holistically both from an engagement perspective, team perspective and compensation perspective and training, we are doing everything that supports them. Pravin, is there anything else that you would like to add?

1644	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Pravin Rao 	 I think one clarification you wanted was around the supply. If you remember whole of last year, the growth for the industry was muted, people had stopped hiring and many of the campus hires’ joining date was deferred. Only in the last quarter or so, with growth coming back people have started to resume hiring and many of the deferred candidates are being asked to join the company. There is a lead time because we have to hire, we have to train them, this training could be four to five months before we can deploy them on the project. So that is what I meant supply catching up, more people we hire, college graduates, train them and deploy them in projects then when the whole situation will ease and we will be able to meet with demand in a much more comfortable way so that is what I was referring from a supply perspective. Other question on the startup, as Salil mentioned we also have couple of specialist teams, one we call power programmer and the other one is called digital specialist. We hire people into these streams that have significantly higher compensation than what we do for normal college graduate. So, that is one way of for us to attract the right talent and we deploy these people on some of the most challenging projects which are very attractive for these people as well. So that is other way we tried to also try to compete and try to get the best of the candidates out there.	1406		1	 So, that is one way of for us to attract the right talent and we deploy these people on some of the most challenging projects which are very attractive for these people as well.

The first one with respect to talent, compensation, and cost as Nilanjan had shared earlier these are things that we have factored in as we look at our cost outlook for the full year, we have already worked with compensation increase, which was rolled out in January, another one which is rolled out in July, there are other mechanisms through promotions, through different approaches, which we have done on retentions and as we bring talent in. Yes, all of those are costs, but those have been factored in as we provide our guidance for the full year, which is operating margin of 22% to 24% .There are many other levers which we use as some of them that we have discussed here for example how we work with subcontractors, how we work with role ratios in pyramid, what we do in terms of digital value with our clients which will help us to make sure that the overall cost and margin equation is how we have committed and how we have forecasted in terms of the market. For the ESG, I will request Nilanjan to give a view on that please.	1065		1	There are many other levers which we use as some of them that we have discussed here for example how we work with subcontractors, how we work with role ratios in pyramid, what we do in terms of digital value with our clients which will help us to make sure that the overall cost and margin equation is how we have committed and how we have forecasted in terms of the market.

1650	\infosys\sep-21.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 On the first one, the point with respect to attrition, I think the focus there in terms of how we work and make sure that we are fulfilling client need is what Pravin was sharing earlier. We have a program which allows us to bring in a lot of employees, that we have now set a target for 35,000 college graduates worldwide that will join us and be deployed. We also have different mechanisms which are focused on making sure that all of the employees have a much greater engagement, a clear career path, a lot more of focus on reskilling, as we move to the digital skill sets, a specialized program where there are digital tags which enable employees to get specialized bonuses, compensation, projects and of course the focus that we discussed on promotions. We think all of these things help us as we shared earlier with the net increase of 8,000 employees in the quarter to demonstrate that our brand, our approach to bringing talent in is still extremely relevant and therefore we are able to fulfill what our client needs are and grow at the pace at which we are growing here.	1081		1	 We also have different mechanisms which are focused on making sure that all of the employees have a much greater engagement, a clear career path, a lot more of focus on reskilling, as we move to the digital skill sets, a specialized program where there are digital tags which enable employees to get specialized bonuses, compensation, projects and of course the focus that we discussed on promotions.

1665	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks, Rishi. Good afternoon and welcome. It is always good to have all of you here on the campus and I am sure you are also enjoying being back in person and being at our campus, so thank you for being here. Our Q2 performance was strong with year-on-year growth at 18.8% and sequential at 4% in constant currency. Growth in Q2 was broad-based with all industries and geographies growing in double digits in constant currency. This momentum is accompanied by a strong pipeline of large deals and the highest large deal value in the last seven quarters at $2.7 bn, 54% of this is net new. These elements are a clear reflection of the deeply differentiated digital and cloud capabilities we have developed, that are highly relevant to our client’s strategic priorities. Our digital revenues are now 61.8% of our overall revenue and they grew at 31.2% in the quarter in constant currency terms. While digital continues to see strong growth rates, we are seeing in this quarter acceleration in the growth trajectory of our core services. This is due to our industry leading-automation capabilities and reflects an interest among clients towards cost optimization programs. We also see this in our large deal pipeline with strong focus on cost reduction programs, in addition to the digital transformation programs in the pipeline. While we generally do not share the specific amount of our cloud revenue, we are delighted to share that in Q2, our cloud revenue was larger than $1 bn showing tremendous strength of our cloud services, especially our industry-leading Cobalt capability. A strong growth was accompanied by an operating margin expansion of 150 basis points, where we had an operating margin in the quarter of 21.5%. This stems from cost efficiencies, optimization in large deals, and currency benefits.  4 Our attrition has been decreasing now for three quarters on a quarterly annualized basis, including now in Q2 and we see this trend along a downward trajectory. In keeping with our capital allocation policy, the board has announced a share buyback of Rs.9,300 crore and an interim dividend of approximately Rs.6,940 crore.  With that, let me open it up for questions. Rishi, over to you. 	2206		2	 In keeping with our capital allocation policy, the board has announced a share buyback of Rs.

The upper end remains the same, but if you could give a sense on what made you tighten the guidance? And also, your share buyback, you have the option to go all the way up to 18,000 as we understand then why capped at about Rs.9,000 crore odd that you have done? 	402		2	 The upper end remains the same, but if you could give a sense on what made you tighten the guidance.

1668	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 On the guidance, we have had an incredibly large deals performance in this quarter at $2.7 bn. We have had strong momentum at 18.8% growth in the quarter. We continue to see good traction. We also see that there is some caution. Last time we had mentioned that we saw some caution in mortgages in financial services. We talked about retail. We now see some caution in hi-tech and in telecom. Keeping all of those factors -- the positive factors and the global macro factors, we have decided to make our guidance narrower at the higher end of the band that we had - so it was 14% - 16% and now it is 15% - 16%. On the share buyback, let me request Nilanjan to address that. 	674		2	 Keeping all of those factors -- the positive factors and the global macro factors, we have decided to make our guidance narrower at the higher end of the band that we had - so it was 14% - 16% and now it is 15% - 16%.

1671	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Let me start with a couple of them. On the margin, Nilanjan will come back on. On the deal wins, I think this is an incredible performance from the company, $2.7 bn is a very large number. We have a very strong focus on large deals and 54% being net new that gives us a really good platform for what we see in the future. Now large deals, we have always maintained, these are volatile. In some quarters the numbers are high, and some are low. These are not very predictable outcomes, but in general, if you look over a four-quarter period, we have a fairly good large deal momentum. Our pipeline for large deals remains quite strong today and it is in a good position. So we feel comfortable with where we are in the market. Just to add, the macro comments that I made in the earlier question, those obviously, still hold.	823		2	 Now large deals, we have always maintained, these are volatile.

1672	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 On the margins, we have improved from 20.0% - 21.5% sequentially, which is a 150 basis points improvement. We have got 70 basis points out of that because of currency benefits, all currency versus the dollar as you know depreciated as well, and of course, there was cross-cost currency impact so that gave us 70 BPS. We got 90 basis points from cost optimization and you are aware of the levers we deploy in terms of the pyramid, in terms of automation, in terms of onsite/offshore, pricing, so between that large deal optimization, and other costs which we have been able to take out are partly offset by utilization, we got about 90 BPS from there. We have got about 40 BPS from reducing our subcon. Again, cost lever which we have been trying to attack gave us 40 BPS and this was offset by about 40 BPS from comp related because some of our comp hikes were rolled out on 1st July as we mentioned. So, all in all, we got 150 basis points improvement. If you see from the guidance perspective and as we had mentioned in the last earnings call, we had said we will be at the bottom end of our 21% - 23% guidance. We  6 are now looking at our first-half performance. We have for this year at least tightened it to 21% - 22% and we expect to be at the bottom end of that band. 	1277		2	 We got 90 basis points from cost optimization and you are aware of the levers we deploy in terms of the pyramid, in terms of automation, in terms of onsite/offshore, pricing, so between that large deal optimization, and other costs which we have been able to take out are partly offset by utilization, we got about 90 BPS from there.

What is the exposure to Europe, especially Germany, and how do you see the TCV pipeline?

1674	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 On the demand environment, what we see is on the macro front, which we had indicated last time is that we started to see some concerns on the mortgage side, in financial services, and in the retail industry. We are seeing this time some concerns in the hi-tech and in the telecom industry, in addition to those, these are more on the discretionary part of our pipeline. We are also at the same time seeing a strong large deals pipeline, which gives us some confidence. We have pivoted and I think the market itself is also pivoting, the clients where there is more and more interest in automation and cost efficiency, and we see that coming through within our pipeline. We have seen growth - both in digital over 30% and in the core which shows that both of our engines are working quite well. In terms of the US and Europe, in Q2 we had very strong growth in Europe near 30%, and strong growth in the US over 15%. We continue to see the pipeline between both of those geographies today, but also keep in mind that we are being watchful given the macro environment developing. 	1078		2	On the demand environment, what we see is on the macro front, which we had indicated last time is that we started to see some concerns on the mortgage side, in financial services, and in the retail industry.

And like we have guided, at the bottom end of 21% to 22%, so, of course, margins for the second half will have to go up. We have our levers in terms of our utilization, which is one of the factors mentioned because we are really at the bottom end of utilization as we put a lot of freshers into the system, now they are sitting on the bench, but over a period of time they will start getting deployed so this will become a tailwind. As attrition starts coming down,  this will be a benefit in terms of stretch salaries so that is one of the other things which started helping us. So, in this range of 21 to 22, we are quite comfortable for the full year as well.	759		2	7%.

Because this talent pipeline for us we knew, in the long run, is the only way this industry would grow other than rotational churn. Therefore, in fact, in the first half we have already done, I  8 think close to 40,000 freshers across the company in all streams. So, we are quite hopeful in terms of absorbing the freshers, putting them through their paces, and then start putting them into large deals and other deals as well and that has been a big learning for us during this entire process. 	776		2	On the operations, as we have mentioned, we have a good margin story but I think even beyond that our ability to absorb freshers and making sure that they are trained, they are picking up new skills, putting them into projects, and then over a period of time start rotating them.

1679	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Rishi Basu 	 Thank you. The next question is from Chandra from Money Control.  Chandra I just want to ask you about the net employee addition number. I mean it is usually a good lead indicator of growth and that has come in at 10,000 I think which is what compared to 21,000 in the previous quarter. So, what does it say about the growth going ahead, I mean because on the one hand you sound confident, but is this also a sign of caution? What are you hearing from clients in conversation because other companies are saying at least in Europe, the discussion is only about how they are going to manage the winter so if you can give us a sense on what you are hearing from North America as well as Europe? For Nilanjan, a question on the margin guidance, you know you have kind of tightened at the upper end at a time when supply side challenges are coming down, again how should we read this? Are there growth constraints, pricing constraints and if you can also tell us about why you are opting for a market buyback for the second time because even the last time many shareholders felt it was a negative move because it really does not benefit them so why are you opting for a market buyback? And one question for HR head on moonlighting. Infosys sent out a missive to its employees on how they should not two time, but if you can give us your views on moonlighting, thanks.	1363		1	 Chandra I just want to ask you about the net employee addition number.

1680	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 On the first question, I think 10,000 is a very strong net addition for us on top of the 20,000 that we had in the last quarter. Having said that, what we see with clients in the industries that I was referring to before, for example mortgages in financial services, retail, or parts of hi-tech  9 or telecom, we see more caution in the way that the buyers, the clients are looking at services. We also see some impact on discretionary spending there. At the same time our pipeline is extremely large, we had a very strong large deals number for this quarter. The way we are looking at it is we are making sure that we support our clients as they are looking for their growth/transformation programs and now more and more for their cost efficiency where we are deploying our automation services and our pipeline has shown that there are more and more of those types of activities as well. Our view is we are ready in this macro environment for all types of client work - whether it focuses on digital and growth, whether it focuses on cost, and yet we want to be careful that we are cognizant of what is going on with the macro environment and make sure that we go into this watchfully so that is how we are seeing this progression happen at this stage.	1254		2	 The way we are looking at it is we are making sure that we support our clients as they are looking for their growth/transformation programs and now more and more for their cost efficiency where we are deploying our automation services and our pipeline has shown that there are more and more of those types of activities as well.

1681	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 On the buyback, I think firstly we have a very predictable capital allocation policy which we believe is really best in class. It is a five-year policy. From FY20 to FY24 we said we will return 85% of our free cash flows so it is a very predictable policy. It has got a dividend element on it and it has got a buyback and an option also to do special dividend and therefore we also look at over this period how will our cash flows change and therefore how do we give back money in terms of both dividends and buybacks or special dividend and therefore we also want to see how much cash will be on the balance sheet. So, it is not about finishing our cash on day one, so we pace all this out. And of course, one of the ways you can do it - is through a tender offer or through an open market offer. For the last two we have done open market offers and the board feels looking at our listings in the US, our regulatory concerns, and EPS accretion that it could be better to go for an open market offer so they look at other considerations as well and we decided to go for an open market. On the margin guidance, I just mentioned we are 20.7% at H1, and like we said, we are going to be at 21% to 22%, at the bottom of 21% so mathematically we will have to be probably closer to 21.4% or something to even hit 21% so we are looking at margin levers going ahead. As we talked about, there will be some abatement from the attrition side, there will be on the same side headwinds because of furlough because it is a seasonally weak quarter as you mentioned, so we will have some headwinds coming from furlough and lower working days and which some of these we will try to offset through  10 our cost optimization, etc., and therefore like we said that 21% to 24% is a narrow band which we will be comfortable with for this year.	1823		1	 It has got a dividend element on it and it has got a buyback and an option also to do special dividend and therefore we also look at over this period how will our cash flows change and therefore how do we give back money in terms of both dividends and buybacks or special dividend and therefore we also want to see how much cash will be on the balance sheet.

1682	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh  	 On moonlighting, let me address it. One of the things that our company is always focused on is making sure that we have real attention to learning opportunities and general opportunities for all of our employees and we have always encouraged our employees to have that sort of mindset within the company. In fact, within the company, we have set up - over the last several years not now, not last week over the last several years a platform which we call ‘Accelerate’ where employees can look at what we call internally - gig work, different projects outside of their main work. On the average quarter, over 4000 people apply for this. About 600 are selected so it is something that is active within the company. Now for gig opportunities in the external environment, we support the aspirations of our employees to learn beyond their work. We will support them to work on certain gig projects after the prior approval of their managers. We are also developing more comprehensive policies for that while ensuring contractual and confidentiality commitments are fully respected. However, to be clear we do not support dual employment.

1688	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 I will start with the first one. I think it was a question about how we convert in this environment different situations to what Infosys can do best. I think that is a very critical point. What we are seeing in this environment is the capabilities that Infosys has. We have a very strong set of capabilities on digital and cloud and we are seeing good traction and growth on those. We also have very good capabilities on automation, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning and efficiency and we are seeing very good traction on the cost programs where clients are looking at efficiency. So what our approach is we want to make sure that both of those pillars and both of those engines are available to clients depending on what situation they are in. And as the macro develop because the macro will change, there could be positive stimulants, there could be negative stimulants so that are things we do not know, but we have both of these engines which are working well and we believe that that will support us as we look at it in a careful way as we go through the next period of time. The second one was about subsidiaries. Nilanjan, do you want to take that one?  12	1186		2	I think it was a question about how we convert in this environment different situations to what Infosys can do best.

We have seen a steady and good increase in our engagement scores across our company. We are seeing real connect where people are seeing, there is a new set of policies and initiatives that our HR team has rolled out for leadership development, for skilling, for making sure that there is much more awareness and support in the time during COVID, both from a medical perspective and also from a mental health perspective, so we are seeing a lot of traction. I do not see any of those levers being something which is a concern. There is always something that is being watched and in fact, we are now seeing the last three quarter’s attrition coming down quite significantly each quarter. In Q2, it was down by over another two points than the previous quarter, so we think some of the initiatives that were put in place are starting to have an impact and we will continue to drive those initiatives ahead.	1077		2	On the layer, I am not aware of people on sabbatical.

Sai Ishwar Sir, you had said that you are seeing caution in mortgages, financial services, retail and that is catching on to hi-tech and telecom as well, right? So, can you actually tell us whether these are discretionary spends that are getting affected, or do you see the total tech spends itself being held back by clients? And also, one more question to Nilanjan Sir is, we are also hearing news  13 about the onboarding delay of freshers, but on the other hand you have already reached the 40,000 targets in terms of fresher hiring, so, how should we read into this? Because we are hearing reports seeing people who got offers in 2021 are not on-boarded yet.

1696	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 On the return to work, we are looking at this every week. Last week, across India, we had about 45,000 employees in the office at any given time, not all five days, but at different times and that is a huge number, given where everyone was in this industry a few months ago. And what we are finding is the approach we have taken so far, we have been extremely supportive of our employees. We have been extremely supportive of a flexible approach, and it has been well received and it is working. We are seeing that this is now gradually increasing. A couple of weeks ago, I was in our Pune DC. In fact, Radha and I were both there. We could see a lot of engagement with employees as we connected with several of them. My sense is that over time, we will make all the support necessary so more and more employees can come back. There are, of course, several client situations which require specific action, so, those will be followed as the clients are requiring it, but where we are able to provide some flexibility, we will continue to provide flexibility. On the attrition, there were several initiatives that Krish and our HR team rolled out, maybe 12/18 months ago, and I think we had shared some of those. There is one of them, for example, where there is a very well-defined path in terms of career in the first several years of an employee and the steps are clearly defined and well understood. That is a big positive for employees so there are no surprises anymore for them. There is a lot of emphasis on leadership development and skilling. There are programs with large global universities which the company runs, which give employees the ability to self-improve, and then we have our online platform, which allows employees to do it. So, there are several of those initiatives as a combination of that and it is worth it. The trend in the last three quarters is good, and my sense is, these initiatives will continue to give us benefit.	1948		2	 There is one of them, for example, where there is a very well-defined path in terms of career in the first several years of an employee and the steps are clearly defined and well understood.

1699	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 I will start with the first one. I think on large deals. We had 27 large deals. So, for us, large deals are deals which are more than $50 million in value, and so it is a very significant size of a deal. We do not give out any specific deal information. To give you a sense, there are 27. That number can then give you a sense, given the overall value of the large deals. On the buybacks, let me start and Nilanjan might want to add. We have a very well-defined capital allocation policy. We have followed all of the reviews internally and externally on that. We feel no unusual activity, whatever sort of phrase you use, it was a well-informed decision by the board, and we think it is going to be a huge positive because we have a capital return approach through this policy and Nilanjan can add a little bit on that in a second. On Ravi, first: Ravi is a good friend. I wish him all the best in his new endeavors. Infosys has incredible leadership talent in my mind. So over time we will make sure that all of the activities are in the best interest of the clients, the employees, and the company.	1101		1	 I wish him all the best in his new endeavors.

1703	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Regarding the hiring of college graduates, I think last year we did something in the range of 80,000 college graduates who joined us. One of the things that we are extremely good at and known for is our training program and especially now that everyone is back in person at Mysuru training centre and in addition to what we have now which is online. We have also set up training for some of the modules within our different DCs, i.e., our delivery centers. We find that these individuals coming out of the Infosys training are extremely ready to start to be productive and they help us tremendously. Last year we had 20% growth, with Q1 having 21%. This quarter has 18% growth, so that needs tremendous input that we see from new employees joining us.	752		2	 This quarter has 18% growth, so that needs tremendous input that we see from new employees joining us.

We also see that there are specific areas in the macro environments where we are more cautious - mortgages in financial services, retail, and some parts of hi-tech or telecom.

1713	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 We have seen inflation across the world and the pandemic in some sort of way across geographies. It is both across consumer prices and wage inflation. And of course, we are going back to many of our clients, one being as part of the clauses which we have like COLA. Sometimes we are going back as part of our digital pricing and trying to demonstrate the value we are able to bring. For instance, in the cost takeout program and how that can be taken back in terms of pricing or productivity with us. So, these are multiple conversations across each client because clients are unique. They speak on tracks, there are T&M contracts, mid-cycle contracts, and new contracts. But the good news is that we have seen a reduction in discounts which is very visible. The kind of discount we would have on renewals, etc. earlier has definitely come down. On the other hand, we are trying to position ourselves to increase our prices on the digital rate card, at the same time demonstrating the value this talent can give. So, the answer is yes, but this is a very long haul, and it will take time. It is not something which we can flip the book on every quarter, but this is something which we are seeing some traction in.   19	1219		1	 On the other hand, we are trying to position ourselves to increase our prices on the digital rate card, at the same time demonstrating the value this talent can give.

1725	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Sandeep. Good afternoon, good evening, and good morning to everyone joining the call and thank you for joining our call. Our Q2 performance was strong with year-on-year growth at 18.8% and sequential growth at 4.0% in constant currency. Growth in Q2 was broad based with all industries and geographies growing in double-digits in constant currency.  4 Growth in constant currency in the first half of FY2023 was 20.1%, compared to the first half of FY22. This momentum is accompanied by a strong pipeline of large deals and the highest large deal value in the last seven quarters of $2.7 bn, 54% of this was net new. These elements are a clear reflection of the deeply differentiated digital and cloud capabilities we have developed that are highly relevant to our client’s strategic priorities. Our digital revenues are at 61.8% of our overall revenue and grew 31.2% in the quarter in constant currency terms. While digital continues to see some strong growth rates, we are seeing acceleration in growth trajectory of our core services this quarter. This is due to our industry leading automation capabilities and reflects an interest among clients towards cost optimization programmes. We also see this in our large deal pipeline with strong focus on cost reduction programmes. While we do not generally share the specific amount of our cloud revenue, we are delighted to share that in Q2 our cloud revenue was larger than $1 bn showing tremendous strength of our cloud services, especially our industry leading Cobalt capabilities. Several examples of client transformation demonstrate the value we deliver – - A European telecommunication company is closely engaging with us to accelerate their business growth and prepare for a digital future. - An aviation giant is working with us to digitally advance the engineering of the product development and emerging aircraft programmes. - A fast-growing logistics company is working with us to secure the cloud environment and build greater resilience into their operations. These examples and several others showcase our commitment to deliver value for our clients and the trust and confidence in our expanding digital capabilities. Strong growth this quarter was accompanied by operating margin expansion of 150 basis points. The operating margin for the quarter was 21.5%. This was because of cost efficiency, optimization in large deals and currency benefits. Nilanjan will provide more colour on this. Our H1 operating margins are 20.7%.  5 Our attrition has now been decreasing for the past three quarters including this Q2 on a quarterly annualized basis. While the overall demand environment continued to be healthy as reflected in broad-based growth and robust large deal pipeline, we also see signs of cautious behavior by clients due to macro concerns. Apart from slowness in the mortgage segment of financial services and the retail industry segment we talked about last quarter, we see emerging concerns in high-tech and telecom industry segments in the form of reduced spend especially towards discretionary programmes. We are well positioned to help our clients with their digital agenda and their cost agenda. Growth in our digital and core services demonstrate that. As the macro environment evolves, both of these components of our business will help us to be appropriately positioned with our clients. We have initiated a pivot to focused cost programmes within our large deal pipeline. Our operating model and offerings are agile to deliver value for clients in this evolving macro environment. In keeping with capital allocation policy, the Board has announced a share buyback of `9,300 Crores or $1.13 bn and an interim dividend of approximately `6,940 Crores or $850 mn. Our H1 performance of 20.1% growth in constant currency and robust large deal signings in Q2 give us the confidence to change our revenue growth guidance, which was at 14% to 16% earlier to 15% to 16%, even as we are seeing emerging concerns that we talked about earlier. Our ability to grow at strong rate and take market share gain is a clear validation of the relevance, depth and breadth of our service offerings and deep client relationships. We change our operating margin guidance for FY2023, only for this year to 21% to 22%, which was earlier 21% to 23%. We anticipate, we will be at the lower end of this range. With that let me request Nilanjan to share other updates. 	4431		2	 This is due to our industry leading automation capabilities and reflects an interest among clients towards cost optimization programmes.

1726	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Thanks Salil. Good evening everyone and thank you for joining this call.  6 Q2 revenues grew by 18.8% year-on-year and 4% sequentially in constant currency terms. All business segments and geos grew in double digit year-on-year in constant currency. Specifically, North America grew by 15.6%, Europe by 28.5%, Manufacturing by 45%, EURS by 24.3%, Communication by 18.4%, and Retail by 15.4%. Digital revenues constitute 61.8% of total revenues and grew by 31.2% year-on-year in constant currency. Revenue growth was 20.1% in constant currency terms in H1 2023 over H1 2022. Client metrics remained strong with year-on-year increases in client count across revenue buckets. Number of $50 mn clients increased by 15 to 77, while number of $100 mn clients increased by 4 to 39. Number of $300 mn clients increased to 5 from 2 in the Q2 last year reflecting our strong ability to mine top clients by providing them multiple services. Employee count increased by approximately 10,000 to 345,000. Utilization excluding trainees was 83.6%. Onsite effort mix remained flattish at 24.4%. Quarterly annualized voluntary attrition came down further by another 2.5% during the quarter. This is also starting to reflect in reduction in our LTM attrition numbers which reduced to 27.1% compared to 28.4% in Q1. We expect attrition to reduce further in the coming quarters. Q2 operating margin stood at 21.5%, an increase of 150 basis points QoQ. The major components of QoQ margin movements were as follows: - The margin tailwinds of 70 basis points comprising of rupee depreciation partially offset by cross-currency, - 90 basis points from cost optimization including large deal optimization, RPP increase, etc., partially offset by lower utilization, - 40 basis points from reduction in subcons spends, - These were partly offset by headwinds of approximately 40 basis points from compensation related increases and impact. Q2 EPS grew by 11.5% in rupee terms on a year-on-year basis. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and debt free. Consolidated cash and investments were $4.8 bn at the end of the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $589  7 mn implying conversion of 79% of net profits. Free cash flow generation is typically low in Q2 due to higher tax payout in both India and the US. ROE increased by 1% year-on-year to 30.8%. Yield on cash balances increased to 5.8% in Q2. DSO increased by 2 days sequentially to 65 reflecting higher billing done during the quarter. Coming to segmental performance, We signed 27 large deals in Q2 with a TCV of $2.74 bn with 54% net new. 5 large deals in Financial Services, 4 each in Retail, Communication, Energy Utility Resources and Services and Hi-Tech segments, 3 in Manufacturing, 2 in Life Sciences and 1 in Others verticals. Region wise 18 in America, 6 in Europe, 1 in India and 2 in the Rest of the World. Growth in Financial Services segment continues to be strong backed by large deal wins, account expansion and new account opening. We continue to see acceleration in cloud adoption in the FS sector and are working with many of our clients in cloud migration, cloud management, and other cloud-related platform deals. In Retail we are seeing focus on digital consumer engagements, supply chain transformation initiatives; cost optimization, legacy modernization and new in-store capabilities. There are, however, some pockets of slowdown in different cycles especially for fashion/apparel retail and general merchandisers. We have a healthy mix of outsourcing and digital deals. In Communication segment we are seeing healthy order pipeline and deal conversion, but we expect cost pressures from client side with impact on budgets especially for traditional services due to macroeconomic concerns. Energy, Utility, Resources and Services segment reported robust and steady growth backed by strong large deal wins. The cost take out initiatives continue to take momentum in the vertical. Manufacturing segment growth continues to remain strong and broad based along with steady flow of new deals. We see continued tech spends by customers driven by the need to increase  8 security posture, migration to cloud, increase the productivity by transforming to smart factory, transitioning to smart products and other broader digital transformation initiatives. In smaller verticals like Hi-Tech as well we are seeing some increasing cautiousness amongst clients around discretionary spend and consequently, there have been some delays in deal closure. For digital services capabilities, in Q2 we have been ranked as leader in 19 ratings in the areas of public cloud, tax, design experience, automation, and data and analytics. We remain committed to maximizing our total shareholder returns and in line with the capital allocation policy of returning 85% of free cash over the period, the Board has recommended the following: - an interim dividend of `16.50 per share for FY2023 versus `15 per share for FY22; this is a 10% increase in dividend per share. - Buyback of equity shares of up to `9300 Crores through open market route post approval of shareholders at a maximum buyback price of `1,850. We believe our progressive capital allocation policy continues to provide predictability to our shareholders. Although there is a gradual abatement of talent cost pressures, they continue to exert pressures on the cost structures and hence will need to be countered by our various cost optimization measures including rationalization of subcons, flattening of the pyramid, increasing automation, reducing onsite mix and engage with clients to increase pricing. While H1 growth was strong we expect H2 growth to be impacted due to seasonality comprising of furloughs and lower working days. The revenue guidance for the year is changed to 15% to 16%. As we mentioned in the last quarter earnings call FY2023, operating margins would be at the bottom end of the guidance band. We are now narrowing the guidance range to 21% to 22% for FY2023 and we expect to be at the lower end of the range. With that we can open the call for questions.  9 Moderator Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. We will take our first question from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ankur Rudra Thank you and good evening. The first question is for Salil, you mentioned the macroeconomic conditions, in that context could you elaborate how realistic or conservative your guidance is for the second half and also what has been the nature of the client conversations in the last month or so and have you seen any impact on the pipeline refill rate in this period?	6674		2	 ROE increased by 1% year-on-year to 30.  In smaller verticals like Hi-Tech as well we are seeing some increasing cautiousness amongst clients around discretionary spend and consequently, there have been some delays in deal closure. Good evening everyone and thank you for joining this call. 6%. 4%, and Retail by 15.  Employee count increased by approximately 10,000 to 345,000. , Free cash flow generation is typically low in Q2 due to higher tax payout in both India and the US.  With that we can open the call for questions.  This is also starting to reflect in reduction in our LTM attrition numbers which reduced to 27.  The major components of QoQ margin movements were as follows: - The margin tailwinds of 70 basis points comprising of rupee depreciation partially offset by cross-currency, - 90 basis points from cost optimization including large deal optimization, RPP increase, etc. 1% compared to 28. 3%, Communication by 18. 50 per share for FY2023 versus `15 per share for FY22; this is a 10% increase in dividend per share.  Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session.  We continue to see acceleration in cloud adoption in the FS sector and are working with many of our clients in cloud migration, cloud management, and other cloud-related platform deals. 8% year-on-year and 4% sequentially in constant currency terms.  Number of $50 mn clients increased by 15 to 77, while number of $100 mn clients increased by 4 to 39. 5%, Manufacturing by 45%, EURS by 24.  Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and debt free.  Although there is a gradual abatement of talent cost pressures, they continue to exert pressures on the cost structures and hence will need to be countered by our various cost optimization measures including rationalization of subcons, flattening of the pyramid, increasing automation, reducing onsite mix and engage with clients to increase pricing.  We expect attrition to reduce further in the coming quarters.  6 Q2 revenues grew by 18. 4%. 8% of total revenues and grew by 31.  Utilization excluding trainees was 83.  We believe our progressive capital allocation policy continues to provide predictability to our shareholders.  Digital revenues constitute 61.  Specifically, North America grew by 15.  We see continued tech spends by customers driven by the need to increase  8 security posture, migration to cloud, increase the productivity by transforming to smart factory, transitioning to smart products and other broader digital transformation initiatives.  There are, however, some pockets of slowdown in different cycles especially for fashion/apparel retail and general merchandisers. 4% in Q1. 8%.  The first question is for Salil, you mentioned the macroeconomic conditions, in that context could you elaborate how realistic or conservative your guidance is for the second half and also what has been the nature of the client conversations in the last month or so and have you seen any impact on the pipeline refill rate in this period. 6%, Europe by 28. 2% year-on-year in constant currency. 5%, an increase of 150 basis points QoQ.  DSO increased by 2 days sequentially to 65 reflecting higher billing done during the quarter.  Manufacturing segment growth continues to remain strong and broad based along with steady flow of new deals.  Growth in Financial Services segment continues to be strong backed by large deal wins, account expansion and new account opening.  We remain committed to maximizing our total shareholder returns and in line with the capital allocation policy of returning 85% of free cash over the period, the Board has recommended the following: - an interim dividend of `16.  We have a healthy mix of outsourcing and digital deals.  Q2 operating margin stood at 21.  - We believe our progressive capital allocation policy continues to provide predictability to our shareholders.	acquisitions dividend invest recommended increasing pay undervalued rising reported uncertain statement improvements encouraging spend said value overweight contribute growing comment outperformed declined neutral fall negative ticker remarks overvalued dropped confidential money continue figures yes declining margins intact proposed numbers not changes positive history complete answered underperformed changed distribute expanded falling deals mixed good data cuts rise progress investments bearish open closed over behind decline increase wrong stable grow clear strong stabilizing closing unchanged limited improving return benefit slowing comments started performance correct adjustments unclear	acquisitions dividend invest removed recommended increasing corp pay undervalued rising reported uncertain name statement improvements clients encouraging orders spend said playing overweight contribute growing forecast comment expanding outperformed declined neutral fund fall negative here ticker overvalued release inc confidential momentum continue figures opportunities yes bullish margins intact ratings rank proposed not changes positive expand history buying complete answered underperformed ranked changed distribute guidance weakening today deals mixed good follow leading data growth private cuts right rise progress report investments struggled bearish announced closed over estimates behind decline increase there wrong stable grow clear strong stabilizing show unchanged limited nothing improving return announcements benefit slowing comments active performance correct adjustments strengthening gains below unclear
1727	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Ankur. On the guidance, I think what we saw was very strong large deals in Q2. We had great growth in Q1 and Q2, we continue to see overall pipeline for large deals is quite strong, in fact, it is larger than it was in the last couple of quarters. We also see the macro points that I shared earlier, specifically mortgages in financial services, some aspects of retail or hi-tech or telecom. So, keeping all that in mind we came with a view on the guidance which was 14% to 16% earlier and now moving it to 15% to 16% which is the higher end of that band. The conversations with the clients we have seen for this quarter, our digital business has grown over 30% and our core services have also grown. We see in our pipeline a good focus on cost programs and on the growth programs. And, there are clients in different sectors at different intensity looking at both of those, so the conversation depends more on the context that the client is in. We feel that given these two engines that we have we are somewhat well prepared for the evolving macro environment. Ankur Rudra Thank you. Nilanjan clearly great to see the margins back in the band and the extent of margin recovery in the quarter. Could you elaborate if there were any special interventions  10 that were taken that drove this change in the quarter or perhaps with respect to wage increases or something else and if there is any one-offs within this? Thanks.	1429		2	 We had great growth in Q1 and Q2, we continue to see overall pipeline for large deals is quite strong, in fact, it is larger than it was in the last couple of quarters.

1728	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 Ankur as we explained, I think our cost optimization engine continues to chug along well. I think working on the pyramid, working on subcons - this was something which was very apparent, you would have also seen the numbers QoQ. So I think it has been an overall continued focus across and we have seen that benefit helping us. But for the year, as we know we are still at 20.7% and we have a guidance of 21% to 22% and we said we will be at the bottom end of that range, so we still have ways to go. Of course, this is going to continue - the conversations on pricing, etc. with clients, like I mentioned in the earlier press conference that our discounts definitely have come down. We continue to push our sales force on how to go and approach clients on this. So, this is a long haul on pricing but at least the discussions have started around this. Ankur Rudra Just one clarification in your margin breakup that you have highlighted before- the impact of compensation increases seemed a bit light, is there any change in the compensation trajectory over the next two or three quarters or if you do not mind may be elaborating that part a bit more?	1152		2	 Of course, this is going to continue - the conversations on pricing, etc.  Ankur Rudra Just one clarification in your margin breakup that you have highlighted before- the impact of compensation increases seemed a bit light, is there any change in the compensation trajectory over the next two or three quarters or if you do not mind may be elaborating that part a bit more.

On the budget cycle, this is the quarter in which we will start to get a sense for the calendar year budget, so it is not something that we have within a grasp from the previous quarter.

The way we look at it today is - the guidance is for our financial year which is two more quarters, we have kept in mind what we have done in Q1 and Q2 and a very strong large deals number that we had in Q2 with 54% net new. We have also kept in mind the seasonality which all of you know, for example in Q3 there will be some impact  14 with furloughs and typically Infosys has more seasonality in Q3 and Q4. And then we built in what we see today of the macro environment specifically those industry segments that I talked about where we see some of the slowing. Keeping all that in mind we built this guidance for the revenue growth given where we are, that is what we factored into the guidance update.	733		2	 Keeping all that in mind we built this guidance for the revenue growth given where we are, that is what we factored into the guidance update.

The margin profile is not so much differentiated on the type of work, there are different scenarios in the margin profile, for example, depending on the scale of the entire industry, the geography, in general we will see that at aggregate level, so aggregate cost program, aggregate transformation programs we will have similar margin outlook. So we do not consider today that pivot itself has any positive or negative impact on margin. However, as Nilanjan was pointing out we have a very strong internal cost program which he and the team has put in place and that will continue to give us benefit in either of the scenarios.	805		2	 The margin profile is not so much differentiated on the type of work, there are different scenarios in the margin profile, for example, depending on the scale of the entire industry, the geography, in general we will see that at aggregate level, so aggregate cost program, aggregate transformation programs we will have similar margin outlook.

I wanted to ask you about the sensitivity of your margins to revenue growth and more specifically what I want to see if you could address this, we look at over the horizon the calendar year 2023, if revenue growth were to slow to something like 10%, just to pick a number, how sensitive is that growth rate to margins and specifically what I am asking, could you reduce the subcontractors and or just let attrition take your headcount lower such that you could maintain your 21% kind of operating margins or just any characterizations on how we should be thinking about the sensitivity of operating margins to the growth rate which I think you can tell by the question, a lot of industry is concerned, growth will continue to slow as we look a little bit longer term than your fiscal year?

1750	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	 I think you have answered most of the questions. Reality is that we can predict our operating margin quite fast and fundamentally in the IT services business, the operating leverage element is quite small compared to other fixed cost businesses. So you can in terms of both the points like you mentioned, first the intake of laterals or intake of freshers, gradual attrition, the subcons, all these four literally by quarter and you can pivot on these to get cost structure in line. So, I do not think it is a big drag unlike high fixed cost industries, so in that sense in the past also we have seen it. A perfect example I would say, the COVID period wherein six months pretty much everybody in the industry when they were seeing negative growth had pivoted at least from the margin front, we did not degrow during that time, but nonetheless given the slower growth at that time we were able to pivot our entire cost model.	926		2	 A perfect example I would say, the COVID period wherein six months pretty much everybody in the industry when they were seeing negative growth had pivoted at least from the margin front, we did not degrow during that time, but nonetheless given the slower growth at that time we were able to pivot our entire cost model.

My first question, Salil, can you help us understand on the deal win side, so we have seen quite a sharp acceleration in deal win especially in the new deal side, which has almost doubled both quarter-on-quarter and YoY basis. At the same time, we are talking about some caution coming in at some of the verticals and some of the clients taking more cautious stance. In that context, what is driving the sharp increase in our new deals wins, is it that these discussions of caution are still at the CXO level and we are yet to see the impact of that in the deal wins or these concerns are getting compensated by a higher focus on the cost side?	701		2	Good evening team and thank you for taking my question.

1761	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 Thanks Rakesh. The deal wins I think represent the strength that we have on both sides of the capabilities - on digital and on core, automation. So what we have seen today is we have the ability to be appropriate for clients depending on what macro they are facing and as the overall macro evolves, we have both sides ready for that. There my sense is we have sort of differentiation from our peers with this approach. We have also put a little bit more emphasis within our pipeline to actively look at automation, cost deals with our clients, so that is driving it. Having said that, it is also to be kept in mind that large deals are deals which are over $50 million for us and we have always maintained that there is no sort of quarter-on- quarter trend on this. It is more to look at for that quarter and that is also something to keep in mind.	849		2	The deal wins I think represent the strength that we have on both sides of the capabilities - on digital and on core, automation.

So if you can provide some sense whether any specific industries where you are seeing more weakness or client specific situation. Second thing is about the deal intake. Now you indicated about cost efficiency program and cost take out programs showing uptick. Do you think it would lead to a higher deal TCV closures in next few quarters?

So, that is where we are seeing a good traction which is also showing up in the growth of core services. Deal TCV again - in a quarter-by-quarter basis it can go up and down because these are deals over $50 million and these deals take some time to build up. As Nilanjan shared, it is 27 deals in Q2, but if I look on an annual cycle there is a good way of looking at large deals across years. So on a quarter- on-quarter basis we do not have a like a simple way where we forecast it, it can go up and down there.	670		2	So on the cost optimization we see good discussions of that with our clients, in some of the industries we see more of that, in others at a moderate level.

So just wanted your thoughts on, do you see that softness sort to continuing and do you think the remaining can sort of hold up, so that is the first question. The second one is I think over the past two years there were lot of smaller size deals that sort of was a reasonable mix overall and that sort of led to faster velocity and deal conversion, deal to revenue conversion.

1773	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Salil Parekh 	 I will start with the second one. In general at a higher level there is no big correlation between the conversion of a deal to revenue. Sometimes there is an immediate large impact because there is early transformation, sometime there is rapid transition and other time it is more drawn out in the size, specifically large deals which is more than $50 million. So, there is no real link to conversion like that which is you can correlate to something.	452		1	In general at a higher level there is no big correlation between the conversion of a deal to revenue.

1788	\infosys\sep-22.pdf	Nilanjan Roy 	  26 Yes so I think that is the cost as a percentage of revenue, but the impact on margin is what is the premium you are paying to subcontractors vs. own employee so it is not a mathematical impact of subcontractor cost coming down from 11 to 10 - by that token if we say if we can bring down subcontractors to zero our margins can go up by 10%. So this is just the premium you are paying to the subcontractors which is impacting your margins. That is the 40 BPS.	463		0	26 Yes so I think that is the cost as a percentage of revenue, but the impact on margin is what is the premium you are paying to subcontractors vs.  So this is just the premium you are paying to the subcontractors which is impacting your margins.  own employee so it is not a mathematical impact of subcontractor cost coming down from 11 to 10 - by that token if we say if we can bring down subcontractors to zero our margins can go up by 10%.	rising reported statement say calculations good benefit said right correct yes margins adjustments progress report contribute comment unclear higher over	increase there wrong changed done clear reference invest reported statement say borrow figures spend orders calculations lower good said different right correct yes margins progress report contribute comment changes unclear higher over

We know this is long-term investment for us. We strongly believe the industry can only grow through fresher intake year-on-year and that is an investment we are ready to make and over a period of time.

1800	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Ajay Seth	Thanks, Pranav. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. May I start with some highlights of our product offerings and our company initiatives. India's favorite car, Swift, became the best-selling car in calendar year 2020. Swift sold over 160,700 units in calendar year 2020, emerging as the top brands in the pecking order. Swift has been the best-selling premium hatchback in the country for the past 15 years, with sales over 2.3 million units. Super  Carry,  which  was  launched  in  2016,  as  first  commercial  vehicle  of  the  company,  has created a niche for itself within a short span, and has become the second best-selling mini truck in  the  light  commercial  vehicle  market.  Sold  across  235  cities  through  over  320  commercial outlets, Super Carrier recorded a market share of 15% in financial year 2019-2020 and nearly 20% in financial year 2020-2021. Recently, the company commenced the export of Jimny three-door, four-wheel drive, all-terrain vehicles to Latin America, Middle East and African markets. In a customer friendly initiative, to further digitize the car buying journey, and provide ease and flexibility to the customers, the company recently launched the Smart Finance service. With the Coming to financial results now. These results have to be viewed in the context of the previous year financial year 2019-2020 at a sales volume growth of 16%, and therefore, lower percentages over the low base may not convey the correct picture. For the period October to December 2020- 2021,  the  company  sold  a  total  of  495,897  vehicles  during  the  quarter,  higher  by  13.4%, compared to the same period previous year.

During the quarter, the company registered net sales of INR 222,367 million, higher by 13.2%, compared  to  the  same  period  previous  year.  The  operating  profit  for  the  quarter  was  at  INR 14,848 million, a growth of 19.3% over the same period previous year, on account of higher sales  volume,  cost  reduction  efforts,  partially  offset  by  increase  in  commodity  prices,  and adverse  foreign exchange  movements.  Net  profit  was  a  quarter stood  at  INR  19,414  million, higher by 24.1% over the same period previous year owing to the above factors and higher non- operating income. Coming to highlights for nine months April to December: The company sold a total of 965,646 vehicles during this period, lower by 18% compared to the same period previous year. Sales in the domestic market stood at 905,015 units, lower by 17.8%. And exports what at 60,611 units, lower by 21.9%.

1802	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Ajay Seth	Yes. So, as I mentioned in the opening remarks that one of the  deterrent to us this time was significant increase in the commodity prices and the uptick doesn't seem to stop, I think some impact of that will be seen in the fourth quarter as well. And we are now working to see what the impact of overall commodity piece is. This quarter saw an impact of almost 300 basis points y-o-y on overall commodity increase, and there was no pricing action that was taken by us in the third quarter. So that was largely the reason for the flattish margin.	546		2	So, as I mentioned in the opening remarks that one of the  deterrent to us this time was significant increase in the commodity prices and the uptick doesn't seem to stop, I think some impact of that will be seen in the fourth quarter as well.

1804	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Ajay Seth	So as you know that we follow a quarter lag on commodities, so really the impact of quarter two has  come  in  quarter  three,  and  the  quarter  three  impact  will  come  in  quarter  four.  And commodities, unfortunately the precious metal continues to see a rise, and especially metals like palladium, rhodium and platinum, which now the consumption is going up because of BS-IV to BS-VI  shift.  So  that's  one  area  of  concern.  And  second,  of  course,  is  that  off  late  the  steel manufacturers have significantly hiked the input costs, so that's going to be the other factor. So we  are at the  moment  trying to compute  in terms  of  what  the impact  would  be  in  the  fourth quarter and thereafter. But it's very difficult to say at this point in time, but there will be definitely an impact of commodity in the fourth quarter.	851		1	So as you know that we follow a quarter lag on commodities, so really the impact of quarter two has  come  in  quarter  three,  and  the  quarter  three  impact  will  come  in  quarter  four.

1806	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Ajay Seth	"So, I think we will have to keep a balance between the market and the pricing action. We will have to see how the demand is. And while on one hand we are reducing the new sales promotion over what we had in the previous year, so that's helping us. But we have also taken surprising action where we have moved our prices in quarter four, I think it will be effective end of January. So  there  will  be  some  impact  to  that  we  will  see  in  quarter  four.  However,  we  will  have  to continue to gauge in terms of how the commodity cost moves up. And therefore, what are the actions that are required internally in terms of cost optimization further. So we have also looked at our supply chain very closely and looked at what are the other methods by which we can offset the commodity cost by various other initiatives that we can take up. So that work is on at this point in time. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Raghunandan NL from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. A couple of questions.

in 
this  segment?  And  secondly, congratulations on the Jimny launch, when can this model be expected to be launched in India? And also, sorry for squeezing the third question.

1807	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Thank you for the question. So on the first question on the replacement buying demand, we have seen a sharp fall in replacement buying demand from about 26% last year to around 19% this year.  So  there  has  been  a  sharp  fall  of  about  7%,  even  7.2%.  It  hasn't  really  changed  in  last quarter, so I guess this is because we still find post pandemic, people are upgrading their vehicles a little less and holding on to their vehicles a little longer. That's also borne by the fact that the average age of the vehicle which is coming into the True Value, for our vehicles, for the pre- owned cars has gone up by almost 1.2 years, from 8 years to 9.2 years. So I think the replacement line has still not bounced back. Although, I suppose, with much better sentiments on the COVID front, I would expect it to bounce back again to around that level of 24%, 25% going forward. On the second question of the Jimny. The Jimmy, as Mr. Seth said in his opening remarks, has been launched for the export markets. And we are currently evaluating whether the feasibility of it being launched in the domestic market. As you may recall, we had shown this Jimny at the Auto  Expo  in  February  2020,  and  we  got  some  really  nice  response.  And  we  are  currently studying the various aspects of the marketing as to when, if at all, we can launch that vehicle in India. On  the  third  question  about  the  CAFE  norms  and  the  postponement  of  the  other  function emission norms, I would request Rahul Bharti to take over. Thank you.	1543		0	 So  there  has  been  a  sharp  fall  of  about  7%,  even  7.

1808	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Rahul Bharti	Sure.  Thank,  Shashank  san.  You  asked  about  hybrid  taxation,  I  think  the  realization  and  the awareness is gradually growing. Because of limitations of charging infrastructure, we need some other  technology  which  is  immediately  scalable  and  which  does  not  depend  on  charging infrastructure  and  still  brings  down  CO2  to  a  large  extent.  So  we  are  continuing  in  that information exercise. That is one. On CAFE, we are in discussion with the government and I think the government should take into cognizance all the entire context of COVID and other issues in  the auto sector,  the  economic  impact  of  regulatory  stringency.

1812	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Yes, the post festive demand has actually been better than expected. After a very high festival demand, we were thinking that there would be a sharp fall, but there has not been a fall. And in fact, at the moment, we have a pending backorder for about 215,000 vehicles. So I think going forward, we would have a situation where the demand is chasing the supply, because supply, at the moment our stock levels are quite low. In fact, we started January with a very low stock, both in the factory as well as in the network.	521		2	 So I think going forward, we would have a situation where the demand is chasing the supply, because supply, at the moment our stock levels are quite low.

So I think we were coming off from a very bad Q1 and we still are not very sure about the COVID sentiment part. Because as you know, while  the  overall  auto  industry has  seen a  month-on-month  improvement  in the  last  five,  six months, in fact, Q3 has been pretty good as you just saw the numbers. But remember, if you compare it with the two years back, then we are still way off. And in fact, probably if you see April, December figures against the year before last year, we are still about 33% off. So I think while there is obviously a sense of relief, and even I would say a little bit of elation for the last three, four months. The way month-on-month has progressed, that we need to be careful and not overdo one thing suppose we hiked up the price too much, then we may be compromising on the demand. On the sentiment side also we are still not sure on the COVID part, it depends on how the COVID pans out. Looks like better sentiment at the moment, but we can't be really sure. And is the reason why we have not been able to increase the price more than what we have done so far.

1828	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	So, for EVs, of course, you must be aware that the entire industry is quite excited. The entire industry, as you know, has been discussing this transition from ICE to EV, I suppose it is going to happen at some point of time. But at this moment, the adoption of EVs is miniscule, globally just around a couple of percentages. And actually, for the factors which have sort of hampered this EV adoption are three, one, the current battery technology does make the cost of acquisition of  EV  vehicles  very  high,  cost  of  battery  as  you  know  is  almost  50%  of  the  cost  of  the  EV vehicles.  Second,  the  infrastructure  for  charging  in  our  country  is  really  small  and  maybe requires a lot of development before this adoption happens in a big way. And third is on the consumer part, our research shows there is a high amount of range anxiety, that is how much kilometers the car will go on a single charge. Besides as you know, in India, parking, unlike in Japan or U.S. where 85% of the cars are parked on the same spot every night, in our case it is just the other way, just around 12% cars are parked at the same spot every night. So, those are the hampering. And what Maruti Suzuki has been saying is that the path to electric vehicles in India will probably be through the hybrids and also because most analysts have been telling that the  adoption  in  India  would  be  around  maybe  7%  to  10%  in  the  next  five,  six  years.  Which means that a large number of ICE vehicles will be produced. And we need to do something about the  emissions  for  those  vehicles,  and  therefore,  we  believe  that  the  path  to  that  ICE  finally converting to EV will be to hybrid and also the use of alternate fuels types like CNG. And that is what we believe is going to be the path to electrification in India. And that is also one of the reasons why we have been saying that maybe the support of the government for hybrid vehicles should  also  continue  in  the  future.  This  we  believe  is  going  to  happen  in  the  next  few  years regarding the electric vehicles. And as far as  Maruti Suzuki is concerned, we are looking for volumes,  we  are  looking  for  a  sustainable  business  model  rather  than  just  an  exhibition  of technology. Thank you.	2290		1	 Besides as you know, in India, parking, unlike in Japan or U.

1830	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Ajay Seth	Right.  So,  the  cost  structure  depends  on  many  factors  and  one  of  them  is  how  fast  are  we expanding our capacities. So, it will depend on our demand outlook and our capacity expansion plan. And earlier also mentioned that we have been in the past couple of years, we have been on the phase of putting up on more capacity, which means that as and when we start utilizing full capacity, we will find full benefit of the fixed cost. And in the interim, you might see a little hangover of the fixed cost, because there could be some underutilization of capacity, or when you initially set up a capacity, you cannot fully utilize it in the first year, it takes about a couple of years before you start utilizing your capacity. So that's one important ingredient of cost, and if the demand continues to be the way it is and capacity utilization gets better, obviously, there will be some play of the operating leverage that you would see. That’s one. Marketing  costs,  this  year  we  have  been  very  conservative.  We  have  not  spent  much  of  the marketing cost because of COVID and also because we were optimizing costs on all fronts, so we did that. But I think moving forward, we cannot afford to not do our marketing bit, because that's  the  cost  not  for  immediate  period  but  for  future.  So  I  think  that's  something  that  will definitely increase. By how much, will depend on what are the initiatives that we are going to take in the area of marketing and sales. So I think that's something that would see an increase from  the  levels where  we  are  this year. This year,  definitely  we  have  not  spent much  on  the marketing area. We continue to focus on all other areas of cost in terms of productivity gains, in terms of optimizing, in terms of digital initiatives that we have taken this year, how much can we reduce our costs by. So I think these are some of the measures by which we will continue to directly focus on the areas of cost. We will spend where we think it is necessary to spend, and which is largely a long- term plan for us. But wherever we think that we can avoid or we can have some better methods of  saving  costs,  we  are  working  on  that  and  we  will  definitely  ensure  to  save  costs.  So directionally,  I  would  say,  one,  operating  leverage  when  capacity  utilization  is  much  better. Second, in all other areas we will try and optimize cost. In marketing also, we will judiciously spend, but given the fact that in future we will have more models coming in and digital initiatives are becoming more and more in our company. So I think that cost is bound to go up from where we are today. So that's broadly the sequence of our cost structure. Thank you. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pramod Kumar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.	2839		1	 Second, in all other areas we will try and optimize cost.

The other question that you asked about blended price hike. Blended price hike, we don't have a immediate answer on that, but it will depend on various models and various variants, etc., based on that. I think the price increase that we have indicated in the market is at the ex-showroom level of up to 34,000, including the taxes. So you have to remove the taxes to see the basic impact. But 34,000 is the upper end, but I think it's starts with .Rs. 6,000 to about Rs.  34,000.  Model to  model  it differs.

Given that financing penetration would be on the rise given the increase in cost post BS-IV to BS-VI and all of that, and because of COVID as well. So how is the customer reaction to the recent price hikes, have you seen some sort of hold up on conversion or anything like that? The reason I am asking is that, if the equity contribution from the customer remains more or less the same and the incremental price increases can be financed by EMIs which will not pinch them, given the current interest cost, is there a thought that probably the industry can afford to take more price hikes in this cycle as compared to historical cycles when rates were high, and the financing dependence was actually not that much.

Even before the pandemic, it was roughly the same. As regards the other thing of whether the conversion itself has come down. As you know, we have a 215,000 bookings which are pending, and we haven't seen that conversion falling down at the moment. In fact, fresh booking flow has also been quite positive. So as you rightly pointed out, probably the effects would be seen a little later, maybe, but we have to wait and see, because it's just been a few days actually, we increased the price I think from the 18th of January.

1835	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Pramod Kumar	And Shashank sir, the reason I am asking this is, if you look at a category like two-wheeler, and most, if not all, most of your customers who buy a car are invariably already having a one or two or multiple two-wheelers in the household. And two-wheeler prices have gone through the roof in the last one year or so, the increase is well enhanced double-digit kind of a number, right? And car prices haven't actually increased that much in the last one year, at least, because of BS- IV to BS-VI. So in such high inflationary environments across categories, be it two-wheeler but every category is seeing massive price hikes. So can't that be the opportunity for the car industry to kind of at least pass through the cost burden to the consumer? And given the fact that 80% customers opt for financing, the incremental cost burden for them in terms of EMI may not be that kind of a deal breaker as such. Because a lot of pricing in the industry will depend on how you behave as a market leader. So I am just thinking, and if we look at other categories prices have really gone through the roof, premium category demand has not got affected in motorcycle, for  example.  So  is  there  a  thinking  that  whether  we  should  probably  look  at  from  fresh perspective and probably at least pass on the cost? Which is kind of going to probably sustain for longer, because that's the feedback generally from the global commodity experts, that this may not go away in a hurry, the kind of prices what you are seeing on the commodity side.	1536		2	And Shashank sir, the reason I am asking this is, if you look at a category like two-wheeler, and most, if not all, most of your customers who buy a car are invariably already having a one or two or multiple two-wheelers in the household.

But if you look at the other side of the demand perspective, then I did mention that we still have a long way to go and if we compare with demand for the two years previous to the current one, we are still about 33% off from those highs. So I think we still have to maintain that fine balance of top-line and bottom-line. So I think the price hike if we were to pass on the entire cost  of  the  increase  in  terms  of  material  costs  and  other  costs,  I  am  sure  you  would  see  the demand evaporating quite a bit. And that is the why, of course, it's just an estimate. We keep making that assessment and try to maximize looking at both the top-line and the bottom-line.	790		2	And from a financial point of view, clearly what you are saying is correct and logical.

1837	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Pramod Kumar	Sir, last one is on royalty. We have moved to this dynamic royalty regime some time back. So just want to understand, given the surge in volumes what you are seeing and royalty, a lot of these milestones are linked to the model performance and the model volume. So by when do you expect  the  benefits  of  such  massive  hike  in  volumes  kind  of  accruing  in  terms  of  royalty? Because that is one cost reduction which could probably accrue to the company. And especially when prices are going up, Suzuki gets the benefit of a higher royalty payout without much kind of incremental work. So can that be a bit of a cost cushion for us incrementally? If you can just throw some light on by when do you expect royalty rates to start easing up a bit?	753		2	We have moved to this dynamic royalty regime some time back.

1838	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Ajay Seth	As we had said earlier that royalty there are two entities now that all the new models will move to the rupee formula, and quite a few of them have already moved to the rupee formula. But by the year 2023, 2024, virtually 95%, 96% of the models would have moved to the rupee formula. So that's one leg. Second leg of course is, if the volumes pick up then there is the second element of beyond certain volumes there is a discount that kicks in, so that will also kick in. So definitely, as we go along, there will be no uncertainty with respect to any exchange variation on account of royalty, that will go away and there will be a fixed amount that we know we will pay. And second, of course, is the volume discount. So both will help. And it will depend on what is the volume growth and how many models go in the discount category. But one thing we are very sure that 96%, 97% models will move to the rupee category, that itself will help and the volume discount will further help. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Binay Singh from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.	1082		1	 But one thing we are very sure that 96%, 97% models will move to the rupee category, that itself will help and the volume discount will further help.

1839	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Binay Singh	Just two follow-on from previous question. In one of the responses, Mr. Seth stated that the key driver for margin expansion will be operating leverage. Could you please expand a little bit on that? Because when you look at December quarter, it seems that you are already running at very high-capacity  utilization,  so  the  incremental  operating  leverage  should  be  very  low  in  the business. So could you expand on, is my understanding correct?	453		0	 Because when you look at December quarter, it seems that you are already running at very high-capacity  utilization,  so  the  incremental  operating  leverage  should  be  very  low  in  the business.

1840	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, I was largely referring to from a cumulative nine month perspective. But definitely, now we are reaching that level of capacity. And based on that, I think the kick in the operating leverage is visible now. As you see that in spite of a 3% increase in commodity prices we have been still able to maintain margins, and frankly, better the margin. So which itself means that there is some kick in of the operating leverage, otherwise the margins would have been much lower. So that's already kicked in. What I am also trying to say is that when we expand capacity subsequently, there will be periods where till the time we use the capacity fully, there could be some overhang of fixed cost which will eventually come down while the capacity is fully utilized. As we go along, if the demand continues to be robust and we need to expand, then typically one year you don't utilize plant fully, in the second year you start  utilizing the plant fully. So there can be some play, of course, at that point in time. So if you compare this full year, obviously, in this full year the capacity utilization would be not more than 70%, 75%. So I was comparing the full year and not just the quarter. So if next year you compare the last year, definitely you will find the operating leverage.	1282		0	 And based on that, I think the kick in the operating leverage is visible now.

So, if you see the passenger car, then our market share has actually gone up and also in the in the C segment, which is the van, gone up substantially and also in the MPV. But you are right, it is in the SUV category that we have lost some amount of market share. As far as the drive for demand is concerned; first time buyers have gone up 5% and the additional car buying has  also  gone  up  a  little  bit.  So  additional and  first-time car  buying  has  gone  up,  (+5%) and (+2%) respectively, and (-7%) for the replacement, and that trend is similar across the industry.	685		2	Yes, so that number is similar for both industry as well as Maruti.

So it did not have that element of specific digital platform and sale through those platforms. As you know, last few years, with the penetration of the internet and change in the consumer behavior, we have seen a huge change in the consumer buying process behavior, and people are preferring a digital route. And that's the reason why we have strengthened our digital  platform.  In  fact,  after  pandemic  it  has  become  even  more  accelerated.  And  we  have introduced some very class-leading programs under this digital platform, including the e-finance space, the marketplace, also the subscription service, the sale of accessories, the sale of spare parts on this platform. We are also going to introduce the True Value, the used car thing on the digital platform.

1852	\maruti\dec-20.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	So  conversion  ratio  and  digital  is  different.  Overall,  of  course,  the  conversion  ratio  varies between 12% to 13%. For digital, it is lower. However, the digital inquiries as a percentage of the total inquiry portfolio that we have has increased substantially from just about 3% in 2016 to 15%, 16% last year, and this time it's almost close to 35%. So while the conversion ratio for digital inquiries is less, however, we do find that the number of inquiries, the percentage coming from digital platforms has almost tripled. So that in a sense gives you an idea of how the digital inquiries and the consumers are inquiring more and more, researching more and more through digital platforms. That's the one which we are trying to catch with our process chain. As regards the e-financing which you referred to, we just started it. Actually we began it with Nexa as a test case in a few cities with a few dealers in our cities. And we are now just a few weeks back started on the arena as well. And we will be adding more banks in that e-platform, and  therefore  with  this  short  period  of  time  it's  done  very  well.  I  would  say,  the  level  of conversion is slightly better. However, we need to see over a period of time how it performs when  we  expand  it  to  the  other  cities,  as  well  as  completely  the  entire  Nexa  and  the  Arena channels.	1377		2	 That's the one which we are trying to catch with our process chain.

Of course, it has its own drawbacks as well as the positives, which you mentioned. But you are right, we can actually reduce the expenses of the launches through the determining factor. The last launch which we had was the S-Cross BS-VI 1.5 liter petrol in August,  which  was  done  entirely  in  the  digital  platform.  And  there  we  got  extremely  good response.

We  are  following  all government protocols and taking all precautionary steps in the best interest of employee’s health and safety including that of our value chain partners. Let me start with some highlights of our product offerings and our company initiatives. We  exported  205,450  vehicles  in  Calendar  year  2021.

However, if you look at the cumulative figures so far for the year, the market share is just around 44%. So, I think judging by that, it does appear that while December market share is close to 50%, but cumulatively it might be difficult to reach that 50% at the end of the year  given the current production scenario. However, in the years forward, I think it's still quite feasible for us to target 50% market share, and that's what we plan to do.	590		1	So if you look at the figure for December, the market share for wholesale was 48. 3% and for retail it was 49. 9%, very close to the 50% mark.

So, it is that which had prevented the growth in  '19-20.

For Maruti Suzuki, I can give the rough figures of around maybe about 6,000 bookings on an average per day, little bit less in January so far.

Last year, the similar figure was 160,000 and the previous year it was 106,000. The penetration of CNG for Maruti Suzuki is now slightly above 15%. And for the eight models in which CNG is there, the penetration is ,30%. Going forward, we do expect CNG to continue to find traction. And for the next year also we think there is going to be a good growth in CNG, judging by the order inflow, pending bookings and also the fact that the CNG network is expanding rapidly across the country and the fuel prices at the pumps continue to be high for gasoline and diesel. My  second  question  is  company  is  targeting  to  fill  white  spaces  ahead  and  some  of  the  new products  would  be  in  collaboration  with  Toyota.

It doesn't help actually, and that's the reason why as a policy we do not disclose the models that we'll be launching in the future, especially we don't make any specific reference to new models.	568		1	So I have mentioned that we have always had a  very strong product plan and a portfolio of vehicles  and  we  will  continue  to  do  that  and  I indicated  the  areas.

And  if  you  see  that,  the percentage of sales in the rural areas actually gone up a little bit in this year. So from around 41%, 41.5% it has just shot up to 43%. So, it does indicate the rural markets are still robust and going strong. And I think there are reasons for it also which we have been stating. The kharif crop has been record, you have had good monsoons back-to-back, the rabi sowing this year so far has been very good, and MSPs have actually gone up. So, we consider that as a good sign for rural growth to continue. And by the way, tractor industry also if you look at the calendar year, it has actually grown on the back of record growth last year.  We expect the rural to continue to show strength.

1937	\maruti\dec-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	So I think individually we have to look at model-by-model. And what I had referred earlier to some question which was raised, the profitability obviously depends on the segment  you are operating in, the competitiveness of the segment, the number of models in the segment, our own cost structure and the cost structure in the industry. So, it's a mix, which not necessarily you can actually differentiate based on an entry SUV or a premium hatch or a mid hatch, etc., By the way, most competitive also in terms of the number of models is the SUV segment. There are about  45  models  which  compete  in  the  SUV  space  as  against  hatches  there  are  only  19.  So obviously, there are pluses and minuses. And we have to look at model wise rather than looking at some overall profitability segment-by-segment.	813		1	So I think individually we have to look at model-by-model.

What he is essentially saying is we don't accept the trade off so easily and so early. I think the best thing that pushes the trade-off far away is excellent products. So if you have excellent products, you will not face a situation where you have to choose the lesser of two evils, either volume loss or profitability loss. I'll give you an example. Celerio has a fuel efficiency of 26.68 km/lt. It's much  higher  than  its  nearest  competitor.  The  CNG  version  has  a  fuel  efficiency  of  35.6 kilometres per Kg. Fuel efficiencies in the zone of 30s is unheard of in India. It's only Maruti who's present in the 30-plus kilometer per Kg club. Similarly, a higher network. If we have a higher volume, we can sell more numbers of the same model as compared to our competition. So these are the methods by which we push this trade-off away. We don't accept that there is a trade-off so easily between profitability and market share. The next question is from the line of Nitij Mangal from Jefferies. Please go ahead.	1112		2	68 km/lt.

We have to keep in mind that global markets do have a sense of unpredictability and surprises, sometimes some country  develops some protectionist measure, and some economy goes up or comes down. So, we  will go along the way and we would like to keep increasing our exports. The next question is from the line of Ashish Jain from Macquarie. Please go ahead. My first question is on market share. Now, if you look at the SUV segment in particular, nearly 35%, 40% of volumes at an industry level, it's actually diesel. In that backdrop, how do we see our market share in SUV even with the new launches? Is CNG a viable option within the SUV space at all or do you think things will not work in that?	927		2	 Now, if you look at the SUV segment in particular, nearly 35%, 40% of volumes at an industry level, it's actually diesel.

1947	\maruti\dec-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	As I explained, Maruti's market share without the SUV is 65%. So, obviously that is an area of interest for us if we have to maintain an overall market share, 50% or thereabout. Talking about the diesel penetration, the diesel penetration currently in industry is around 18%. But if you look at segment wise, it's quite different. And you're right, passenger cars just around 2% and vans around 4%. If you see the SUV space, there the entry level SUV is only about 20%. It is actually in the mid-SUV that you see some traction, in diesel around 58% or thereabouts. But remember before the Brezza came with that K-15 petrol engine, the diesel share of even entry SUV was about 88%, 89% just a couple of years back. So in a couple of years, 88% diesel actually became just around 20% in the entry SUV. And we would expect that going forward, if we have some really good products in the mid-SUV which are petrol, then also you could expect the sharp fall in the diesel percentage in the mid-SUV space as well.  In the SUV space, the diesel share is roughly about 37% which used to be about 95% three, four years back. So it has rapidly come down from about 95% to 37% and even more rapidly in the entry SUV segment. So if you see some play in the mid-SUV segment for a good petrol SUV, then you might find the same story being repeated there as well. Is CNG an option in SUV?	1372		1	 So it has rapidly come down from about 95% to 37% and even more rapidly in the entry SUV segment.

1954	\maruti\dec-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, sequentially, there has been improvement in virtually all areas except for the fact that the sales promotion cost is higher this quarter, compared to the previous quarter. But if we look at our initiatives at the cost side and including the commodity, there has been an   improvement. There has been significant improvement in the exchange rate. And also, there has been some reduction  that we see in the overheads, where we’ve cut down on some of the expenses.  So, overall, you  will  see  a  reduction  on various  accounts.  Mix, of  course,  has  a  positive  impact, because the proportion of bigger cars have gone up. So there’s a favorable mix that we see in our  portfolio.  So,  it’s  a  combination  of  these  factors  which  has  resulted  in  improvement  of profits, in spite of the fact that the sales promotion is a little elevated in this quarter. So, that’s precisely the answer to your question.	920		2	 But if we look at our initiatives at the cost side and including the commodity, there has been an   improvement.

I don’t think that moving forward, you are going to see more impact, because this has mostly been factored in now. There could be some small impact that we will see in quarter 4, not significant impact. And then we will have to watch the trend of the commodities moving forward for the next year.

1964	\maruti\dec-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, in the beginning we talked about the kind of traction that we have on the SUV segment. And the demand for the newer models and the bigger cars is significantly higher. In fact, there is not so much pull for small cars at this point in time. So, the mix is gradually changing towards bigger cars and the price difference between the two is significant. So, if you’re selling one Alto versus one Brezza or Ertiga or a XL6, it’s almost two and a half to three times higher. So, that mix makes a significant difference and the realisation increase that you are seeing now is basically because of that mix change. Even in the order book the bulk of the orders that we have are for the bigger cars.	696		2	 So, the mix is gradually changing towards bigger cars and the price difference between the two is significant.

Because if Indian Passenger Vehicle market has to grow from the current  3% penetration, we want more people from the 97% club to come into the 3% club and chances are that their first car would be a hatch. So, we would like to  facilitate  that  to  the  maximum.  Unfortunately,  whatever  cost  increases  that  we  have,  in percentage terms, the impact is higher on smaller cars, because the cost increase is fairly constant in absolute terms, but on a lower price of the car, it translates into a higher percentage. So, we would  like  hatches  to  continue  and  fortunately  there  is positive  growth  as you  said,  but  as  a segment the share has come down.

So, as far as the safety regulations are concerned, six airbags, three-point seatbelt and seatbelt reminder, SIAM is in discussion with industry on the lead time for implementation. So, that is already under discussion. We are not discussing cost much but it generally cost about Rs.20,000 higher for the entire system of airbags including the electronics, the controllers the total delta in cost between a two airbag car and a six airbag car. On RDE, it is actually a subset of BS6 phase II, BS6 phase II have RDE & diagnostics. So, we are comfortably positioned to meet it, not much cost impact either, at least on gasoline, I do understand on diesel there would be a sizable impact. And this is one of the reasons why we had taken the call on diesel much earlier. And with every passing day, the feeling gets reinforced that we took the right decision. The last is CAFE. I do not know how many of us are aware Maruti has the least fleet carbon dioxide emissions in the entire Indian car industry, despite all the global players present here. It will  get  better  with  time,  so  this  year  would  be  better  than  last  year.

When  we  look  forward  into  next  year  and  you partially answered this question, on the hatchback segment obviously this year we’ve grown but on a four to five year basis it continues to be on the lower side, where do you think the trigger could come from, is it just because rural is also strong as per your commentary so, is it just the cost increase which has happened or the customer preferences have changed one way and this is just something that will continue or is there something which will be a trigger for the car category to actually start growing especially the segment which is five or six lakh below, because if the share  of  first  time  buyer  does  not  rise,  do  you  worry  that  the  momentum  for  the  overall  car market or the passenger vehicle market could slow down over the next 12 months?	872		1	Most  of  my  questions  have  been  answered.	behind confidential answered comments comment name statement not clear reference correct ticker show	behind complete increase neutral missing underperformed answered stable fall grow changed clear reference here ticker removed release confidential reported name statement today figures orders grown good comments names correct yes intact below comment unclear positive

Possible triggers could be, one, the income distribution, if in that segment more employment and income creation happens in the economy, it will be very good for us. And at least in terms of regulatory requirements there would be some headwinds. The cost of such requirements impacts smaller cars more. So, let’s wait and watch for some more time how the economy shapes up.

Some things in the engine and fuel lines, they need  to be  changed  and  some  additional  sensors  and  some  additional  equipment needs  to be installed such as heaters, ethanol sessor to detect the percentage ethanol in the tank, corrosion resistant pipes, et cetera. This is for the cost of the car. In terms of running cost, the ethanol has to be at least about 35% cheaper than petrol for anybody to start using ethanol because the energy content is about 30%-35% lesser. So, that is on the running economics and what we are excited about ethanol is the carbon benefits, because given the biofuel, the biogenic nature, the carbon emissions are significantly lower and India because of its agricultural context can produce huge quantities. So, we will support the government in this technology.	854		1	So, it has a cost impact over a normal gasoline car.

2013	\maruti\dec-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	So,  I  made  two  points,  please  understand  that  the  commodities  and  foreign  exchange  impact comes to us with a quarter lag effect. So, effectively most of the rates that you see are for the previous quarter. So, therefore, there is a significant benefit that you see from quarter 2 to quarter 3. We have captured the quarter 2 rates, therefore the increase in benefit, even for quarter 4, there will be a blended quarter 3 benefit that you will see. We are completely hedged for the year as far as the Dollar-Yen is concerned. So, therefore on the Dollar-Rupee side on the direct imports, we are Dollar surplus. Although if you take indirect import, we have payables, it’s not a very significant portion as it used to be earlier given the fact that royalty is now paid in Rupees. So, there will be benefit of foreign exchange in this quarter and it will remain stable next quarter. However, moving through the first quarter of next year, we will have to see, we are partially hedged of exposure. We’ve taken hedges for next year as well. So, we’ll have to see what rates we finally get based on the exposures that we will incur in the first quarter, but definitely the favorable rates that you see in quarter 2, 3 and 4 maybe reverse slightly in the next year. On  the  commodities  I  mentioned  that  commodities  have  been  cooling  off,  we  have  seen  a reduction  in  steel  prices  which have  been  negotiated  for  the  year.  So,  we  are  very  clear  that commodities will remain where they are. The precious metals are also stable at the moment, barring a few commodities which have shown some inching up like copper, et cetera. So, there could be status quo in fourth quarter or slight increase or slight reduction depending on how they shape  up.  But  for  the  next  year,  it’s  difficult  to  predict  now  because  it  will  depend  on  how commodities  cycles  move.  We  do  take  hedges,  from  time  to  time,  on  the  metals  that  can  be hedged  and  we  have  positions  that  we  have  taken  for  this  year  as  well  as  for  the  next  year, especially on precious metals, and a few other commodities. Great sir, that is very helpful. Sir on the FOREX side just to remind us, Yen will be around 12% or 13% of your sales, Yen denominated direct and indirect imports, would that be a fair number?	2341		2	 So, effectively most of the rates that you see are for the previous quarter.

2019	\maruti\june-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	I'll answer the first part which is related to the revival of demand post the lockdown. So, the demand in July seems to have picked up once we had the unlock in most of the states. Now, except for two states of Northeast, Manipur and Mizoram, all other states are open. As a result, we have seen a pick-up in the case of enquiries as well as bookings, as also the daily retail. So, if you compare it with the peak of last year which was Q4 average, enquiries are roughly similar, although the bookings are about 80%, 85% of the Q4 of last year. If you compare sequentially with June, then enquiries and bookings are about 20% above last month and the average retails are similar to the June levels. That is the extent of recovery, and we believe this time the recovery is led by both urban as well as rural unlike last year which was mainly led by rural.	854		2	 So, if you compare it with the peak of last year which was Q4 average, enquiries are roughly similar, although the bookings are about 80%, 85% of the Q4 of last year.

2020	\maruti\june-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	"Kapil on commodities, I think we continue to see an increase in commodity prices and typically for part of the commodities we have a quarter lag. So, we will see increase in commodities in this quarter as well as the next quarter beyond which we will have to watch in terms of how the overall  commodities  move  and  we  are  hopeful  that  towards  the  second  half  of  the  year,  the commodities may stabilize from these levels that they're peaking at, and all may come down a bit.  So, 
that 
is  on 
commodities.  Commodities 
increase  has  been  pretty 
steep,  quite unprecedented, I mean, we haven't seen such sort of increase before for many decades and that's a major impact on our margins. On price increase, I think we have been gradually taking price increases; we've done a price increase as recently in July and prior to that we have taken in April price increase. So, to the extent that we can increase the price in the market we are doing it, but there is also a limitation of how much price increase we can take which does not disrupt demand at the same time. So, we will take a collaborative call between cost and price and accordingly deal with it as we move forward."	1191		2	 So, to the extent that we can increase the price in the market we are doing it, but there is also a limitation of how much price increase we can take which does not disrupt demand at the same time.

2021	\maruti\june-21.pdf	Rahul Bharti	Kapil, to answer your third question on technology, for the purpose of crude oil import reduction for reducing our carbon footprint for the environment, we will be working on all technologies that  help  us  towards  this  objective  which  means  one,  at  the  grass  root  level  IC  engine improvements,  two,  electrification  and  hybrids  and  they  are  part  of  the  same  family,  hybrid electric and battery electric and three, natural gas and biofuels also recently. We will be working on  all.  Now  some  segments  have  a  higher  propensity  or  faster  absorption  of  some  of  these technologies, so different segments will respond to different technologies differently and we will be pursuing all of them in a manner that it gives us highest returns. You might have heard the recent news that there is a joint testing program of some electric vehicles, these prototypes will be  tested  starting  next  month  along  with  Toyota  that  we  are  planning  to  get  more  consumer feedback on usage pattern, etc. Till the time charging infrastructure grows in India and you will need self-charging machines, so towards that we will be using hybrid electric vehicles. We are also very hot on the way natural gas is progressing in the country. The Prime Minister has a mission to increase usage of natural gas from 6.3% to 15% in the overall energy basket, and CNG and PNG are two major pillars of that. So, we will be wholly participating in that program. Many new cities have come up and the penetration of CNG cars you would have seen have gone up dramatically. And Mr. Shashank Srivastava will just show some very interesting statistics about  CNG  soon.  And  we  are  also  responding  to  a  government  program  on  ethanol.  The government has mandated E20 by 2025 and they are talking about biofuels. The good part about biofuels is that they are carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative. So, we'll be seriously evaluating them. So, we'll be firing on all cylinders to reduce carbon and to reduce oil import in the country. The next question is from the line of Pramod Amthe from InCred Capital. Please go ahead.	2138		1	 So, we'll be firing on all cylinders to reduce carbon and to reduce oil import in the country.

Also, there has been some impact on account of COVID-related expenditure that we've incurred earlier in the quarter, expense with respect to vaccination and number of cases which were to be hospitalized, so there is an expense to that extent. So, I think these are some of these exceptional items which have come in here because of which there is a slight increase that you see. Some of them will not be repetitive if COVID situation normalizes but some may continue if we have a third wave of COVID. So, in this scheme, I think about ~INR 30 crores of expenditures has been put in which is not repetitive in nature. Other than that, the normal increments and this year also we have a wage settlement, so provision is included in the employee cost that you see.	888		0	One, of course is the base effect because the overall sales volume were down compared to Q4 if you see.

I think Seth san just mentioned that we have to take a calibrated view that we cannot pass on the entire cost increase due to the material cost going up to the consumer because you may disturb the stability of the demand itself. So, yes, we do take segment-by-segment, the demand patterns and see how much the consumers can absorb of the substantial material costs which have gone up and we have calibrated that and that is why you see apart from the increase of I think ~1.3% of ex-showroom price or so in January, we have taken another increase of ~1.6% of ex-showroom price in April. In July also, we have taken a small increase and going forward we will watch how the material costs move to calibrate further increases in the prices.

Firstly,  Precious  metals  we  would  know because that comes with a quarter lag and increase in precious metals prices is also pretty steep. That's more or less on precious metals. For steel, the demand by the steel units is still higher compared  to  first  quarter  which  is  being  negotiated.  I  think  the  commodity  impact  would continue to be rising till the second quarter, after which we think there will be correction and we might see that coming down.

2035	\maruti\june-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	On the second question of the first-time buyer and so on, actually as you know, last year the first-time buyers went up in the industry from about 43% to 48%, there was a 5% up on the first- time buyer. Replacement car buying came down about 8% from about 26% to 18.5%, there was an 8% drop in the replacement car buying. The additional car buying went up by about 3%. That was for last year. The first quarter of this year, we don't have the industry figure yet because the research is done with the time lag, but for Maruti Suzuki the first-time buyer came down a little bit in Q1 to about 45.4% against 46.9% in the same quarter last year. Going forward, we do believe  that  the  replacement  car  buying  should  increase  because  that  ~25%has  been  the percentage of replacement buying pre-COVID for previous three, four years. So, I believe that once people are confident enough to replace their old cars with new ones, replacement car buying should again creep up in that range of about 25%, 26%.

So, clearly there is a lot of traction in this industry, mostly it is in the mid SUV and the entry SUV. The entry SUV and the mid  SUV are roughly equal in terms of volumes  as far as the SUV segment is concerned. For example, last year was the 16% for entry SUV and about 15% was mid-SUV. So, you are right, while in entry SUV we have the Vitara Brezza which is the class leading with the  1.5-liter  K-Series  BS-VI  compliant  engine,  it's  the  market  leader,  it's  still  leading  by  far; however, in the mid SUV segment, probably a weak spot for us because we have the S-Cross which hasn't performed as well.

It's difficult for me to comment on the specific products or plan for the SUV segment.	1024		0	SUV segment has been growing over the years; it was in FY 2019-20 only about 26% of the industry, last year it touched 32%, in this quarter it was 37.

2071	\maruti\june-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	You  are  very  right.  If  I  answer  the  first  part  of  your  question  we  believe  the  SUV  segment growing to around 42%, 43% in next five years but that is based on consumer understanding and consumer surveys. And also, our look at the other countries which are seeing a similar pattern, normally it plateaus around 41%, 42% and that's what we are seeing in India as well. That's the first part. On the second part of your question of the premium hatchback, cross consideration between premium hatchback and the entry level and even the mid SUV, you are right there also, there seems to have been a bigger price overlap especially with the entry SUV the sub-4 meter because  of  tax  considerations,  the  price  overlap  is  quite  large,  and  we  have  seen  a  cross consideration increasing from roughly about 14% a couple of years back to almost 30% between premium hatch and the SUV. So, yes, a part of those volumes is being driven from the premium hatches, but we also believe that a large part of it is coming from the Sedan segment which has seen a dramatic growth downwards; Sedan segment as you know was 23% about five years back, now it's just under 10% in this quarter. So, I think the significant shift has happened from the Sedan to the SUV. The next question is from the line of Arvind Sharma from Citi.

2077	\maruti\june-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	No, so, this is what I said are the ones which would have been better if there was no commodity increase and if the volumes were at the same level as we saw in the preceding quarter. But there are other measures that we would have taken, for example, we have significantly reduced our fixed costs in this quarter and that's in the context of the extremely difficult situation we had to cut costs everywhere. Obviously, when volumes will go up, some of the marketing costs will also accordingly go up. Therefore, I mentioned that while I talked about if all other costs remain same, operating leverage of 4%; however, there's also an element of fixed cost, that will go up when your volumes go after especially the marketing cost, we have been very low for example on advertisement cost in this quarter, it's likely to go up. So, there will be a benefit of operating leverage, whether it is 2% or 3%, it will depend on what is our strategy in terms of our marketing spend  and  the  other  fixed  cost,  but  definitely  there  is  a  scope  of  improvement  on  operating leverage, anywhere between 2% and 4%. And secondly, commodity will depend on how much is our ability to pass on. As we mentioned, we will have to take a collaborative call-in terms of how much can be passed on. We've done some correction in selling price in April and July. So, in piece increase in April had some impact but much smaller. Similarly, now, when you see the impact of July price increase and if there is any subsequent increase that happens, you will see that impact also to mitigate the commodity price. Other important thing is to know is that this will also stop at some point in time when all the price increases that we would have done will accumulate that will give you an exact impact for a particular quarter. It's a moving average, it's not a constant. It will depend on all these factors in terms of commodity, where price increase ends up, and where your fixed costs ends up going forward.	1986		2	 Other important thing is to know is that this will also stop at some point in time when all the price increases that we would have done will accumulate that will give you an exact impact for a particular quarter.

So, in that sense there is a connection between both the volumes which  we  are  targeting  as  well  as  the  market  share.

While we look at it as a single entity, the price hike and the demand actually we have to break it down into segments. As you know, different segments have different price elasticity. So, we have to make estimate not just of an overall hike but also specific to the segments where the demand is coming from. So, we have to take into account all that and as Seth san very rightly mentioned we then take a calibrated call depending on those segments and the elasticity. The next question is from the line of Nishit Jalan from Axis Capital.

2091	\maruti\june-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	Kapil, the cost inflation on commodities comes with a quarter lag. So, this quarter was affected because the effective prices were for the fourth quarter of last year, which had to be indexed and increases were to be given to the vendors. We had an impact on commodities all across, including steel and precious metals. The impact was to the extent of about a little less than 2%. And while we were able to partially offset this impact with the price increase that we did and there was also some incremental impact of the sales  promotion  cost  being  higher  sequentially  compared  with  fourth  quarter  in  this  quarter.  So,  that broadly is the reason for the drop in operating margins that you see sequentially between quarter 4 and quarter 1. Moving forward, we are hopeful of commodity prices cooling. It is difficult to give any fixed guidance at this point in time because these situations vary, but we have more clarity on quarter 2 because quarter 2 rates are fixed to quarter 1. We definitely see prices across all commodities, including steel and other metals being low, much lower than what they were in quarter 1 of this year as you've seen in the results.	1175		0	 We definitely see prices across all commodities, including steel and other metals being low, much lower than what they were in quarter 1 of this year as you've seen in the results.

But if we are to see anything from the Grand Vitara, based on feedback fromthe journalists, and the auto experts at the launch; almost unanimously, there has been a very strong positive reaction on it. I'm yet to hear a single remark about any lacuna or weakness in the model. In terms of technologies, it is very strong. Almost  everything  that  we  can  think  of  is  there.  There's  a  giant  panoramic  sunroof,  all  features  like Heads-up display, ESP, hill hold assist, 360-degree camera and it has a muscular stance, large body, I mean,  all  dimensions,  length,  width,  height,  are  good.

2098	\maruti\june-22.pdf	Gunjan Prithyani	Just 2 questions. Firstly, the extension on the margin. You mentioned about 200 basis point impact of commodity. Against that, we had offsets available from price hike, which is almost 1.3%, which we had announced and then we had the yen depreciation, which benefited as well. So, in that context, the 1% decline that is there in the gross margin seems a bit steep. So, if you could just give us more color, maybe help us quantify what were the promotional spends? Or did we really see any yen depreciation benefit in this quarter? Some quantifying around that will help us.	574		2	You mentioned about 200 basis point impact of commodity.

2099	\maruti\june-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, as I mentioned earlier that there was this commodity impact, which was partially offset by selling price  increase  and  sales  promotion  cost  was  sequentially  higher  from  Q4  to  Q1.  So,  the  net  impact between the selling price increase and the material cost was still about 1.2%, as you see in the numbers. Besides that, there was an increase in the employee cost because usually in the first quarter, you will always see the regular impact, of salary increases and retirement benefit which are built in, which was about 0.6%. So, these are 2 major factors for the movement of operating profit between quarter 4 of last year and quarter 1 of this year.	668		2	6%.

Now clearly, it's good to see that response to the strong hybrid. Just trying to get your thought process. There is about 45%-50% diesel share in this category. So, how are we thinking about competing with the diesel portfolio there, given hybrid still suffers from higher taxation.

Secondly, customers are yet to see a very powerful product with efficient gasoline in that segment. I may also remind you that in the entry SUV segment, the diesel to gasoline ratio used to be 80:20 a few years ago. After the entry of Brezza (BS6), it reversed from about 80:20 to 20:80. And now even the 20% diesel has now become about 18.3% diesel. So, if customers get a good product, they'll lap it up.	544		0	The hybrid taxation is a  shade lower than the diesel taxation in that  segment (Mid-SUV).

Also, on a larger view, if India has to decarbonize, there's a major advantage with strong hybrids because they do a good fraction of the job of an EV and are many times more scalable.

And I think it is not just OPEX, customers are attracted to a new technology, and they want to embrace it fast. And there is some sensitivity about lower carbon emissions also. So, this is very  positive.  And  along  the  way  when  customers  actually  see  the  car  and,  in  the  display,  it  clearly explains how the battery plus motor combination is providing the power to the wheel or the engine is providing power to the wheel.

Clearly, the business is going in a very different manner. Actually, the first question is when we look at the business, Maruti seems to be at a very interesting point that your Brezza top-end variant has strong bookings and even in Grand Vitara, you have a sizable hybrid order book. So, my question is on the hybrid side, how to think of profitability for that segment for Maruti? It's very  clear  that  the  ASP  jump  will  be  quite  sizable  that  the  business  will  see.  But  how  to  think  of profitability because it's a Toyota technology, Toyota is manufacturing the car. So, how to think of EBIT per car or margins? Any indication you could give.	799		1	Firstly, when we look at the ASPs of the business with the Brezza top-end variant selling and the Grand Vitara coming in.

If a technology succeeds and picks up volume, then automatically, economies of scale will pick up and the customers will be willing to pay more for it. So, any new technology, whenever we have launched, we had kept a larger purpose in mind. And along with that, we localize, we do cost reduction. We do innovations and improvisations, and we achieve our desired margins. So, at the moment, we are far more focused and concerned about the growth of this technology in India and the benefits that it will bring. And along the way, obviously, if the volumes pick up, it will be healthy on bottom line also.	678		2	 If a technology succeeds and picks up volume, then automatically, economies of scale will pick up and the customers will be willing to pay more for it.

2157	\maruti\june-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, they are 2 different parts. Sales promotion really are the discounts that we offer, and discounts will keep varying depending on the type of mix that you are selling and also depending on demand and supply at any given point in time for each of the categories or models that you are selling. Overall discounts are much lower than what they used to be typically a couple of years ago, and we have seen a significant fall. But yes, quarter 4 wasRs. 11,000 or thereabouts. And this quarter, the average discount has gone up by Rs. 1,500. And I mentioned, the reasons are largely to do with that of the mix or situation of a particular market or particular territory where you have to offer some schemes. The second question that you asked about launches etc. That is more of marketing cost. And marketing costs, obviously, will depend on what promotions you are doing and what launches you are doing at a given point in time. Last year, typically, we had virtually very negligible activity on marketing side. So, we had mentioned also in our earlier calls that the marketing cost, obviously, will go up this year because of various launches and other promotions. The physical conferences that we were not having earlier, we have started having now. So, all that will count towards marketing expenses. So, there will be some increase. But hopefully if overall volumes go up, then you will get that operating leverage also, which was not available last year. We take the next question is from Ashish Jain from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Sir, my first question was on the 6 airbag norms, which is now pretty much seem it's effective from first of October. So, can you speak a bit about what is the cost implication? And  also, if you go by media articles and Maruti will have to do a lot more designing in all, especially on the entry-level of the car. So, any update on that would be very helpful.	1897		1	 And I mentioned, the reasons are largely to do with that of the mix or situation of a particular market or particular territory where you have to offer some schemes.

2160	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	"Thanks, Pranav. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I hope you and your families are healthy and safe. The country is experiencing an unprecedented situation because of this pandemic. We pray for speedy recovery for the people who are battling with the COVID-19 infection. We will continue  to  observe  all  COVID  COPs  and  precautions,  be  sensitive  to  the  human  and  social elements, build an environment of positivity and keep working hard as our bit in these difficult times. May  I  start  with  the  business  environment  that  prevailed  in  financial  year  FY  2020-2021.  It began with a nationwide lockdown imposed by the government to keep the pandemic in check, resulted  in  no  sales  in  April  2020.  We  used  this  time  to  help  produce  and  donate  masks, ventilators and PPEs, of which we had no past experience. The lockdown resulted in severe cash flow  challenges  for  the  company's  suppliers  and  dealer  partners.  The  company  immediately provided cash flow support to wherever it was required for sustainability of our suppliers and dealer businesses. Many companies in the industry who did not have surplus cash could not take such remedial measures. When the operation began post the gradual ease of lockdown restrictions, the company faced the twin challenge of ensuring safety of health of all the people across its value chain and ensuring continuity of operations, to put the business quickly back on track. We accorded utmost priority to ensure the safety of health of all people across the value chain. The company collaborated with  stakeholders  and  jointly  prepared  detailed  standard  operating  procedures  catering  to Net profit for the period stood at INR 42,297 million, decreased by 25.1% compared to that in the  previous  year  on  account  of  lower  sales  volume,  increase  in  commodity  prices,  adverse foreign exchange movement and lower non-operating income, partially offset by lower operating expenses and cost reduction efforts. In 
line  with 
the 
financial  performance  of 
the  year  and  considering  uncertain  business environment, the Board of Directors recommended a dividend of INR 45 per share (face value of INR 5 per share) for FY 2020-21. We are now ready to take any questions, feedback and any other observations that you may have. Thank you. Thank  you  very  much.  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  we  will  now  begin  the  question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Kapil Singh from Nomura. Please go ahead."	2528		2	 The country is experiencing an unprecedented situation because of this pandemic.

We have also substantial pending bookings. But yes, on the retail  front,  because  there  has  been  a  lockdown  in  nine  states  so  far,  including  Maharashtra, Delhi,  Chhattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  MP,  Rajasthan,  Karnataka,  Meghalaya  and  Mizoram,  they constitute roughly about 35% of the monthly sales. So, in that sense, the retail might be a little affected in these areas. But as we go forward, the current levels of bookings and the inflow and the inquiries, it seems to be okay. Although I must hasten to add that the auto demand is very closely related to the sentiment, being a discretionary purchase. And if this COVID thing persists for a longer time, then obviously the sentiments of the consumer get negatively impacted. But we have to wait and see how long this situation continues.	934		1	 But yes, on the retail  front,  because  there  has  been  a  lockdown  in  nine  states  so  far,  including  Maharashtra, Delhi,  Chhattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  MP,  Rajasthan,  Karnataka,  Meghalaya  and  Mizoram,  they constitute roughly about 35% of the monthly sales.

On the rural-urban, we saw, and it was, I think, reported in the press conference also, the rural growth last year was about 7%. And therefore, the overall increase in the rural contribution to the total sales was about 2.5%. So, from about 38.5%, it has now gone up to 41% in terms of contribution. Going forward, I think the rural demand still continues to hold, although in the Q4 of last year urban demand also came back strongly. But going forward, I think, given the kharif sowing being very good, the rabi crop also being very good and the monsoon is expected to be near normal. As of now, it appears that the rural would continue to see the upswing, which we have seen in the recent past.	767		2	 On the rural-urban, we saw, and it was, I think, reported in the press conference also, the rural growth last year was about 7%.

If you can just help us understand, what has been the exact extent of price increases what you have taken in  January-April? And how much of further commodity pressure is still lying with the company in terms of which has not been spiced out yet to the market? And related to that is the cost reduction effort outside of commodities what you are kind of undertaking, I am pretty sure you are working on all of these. And if you can just help us understand how meaningful they could be, and by when can we expect these cost reduction efforts to kick in?	599		1	If you can just help us understand, what has been the exact extent of price increases what you have taken in  January-April.

2172	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, we took an increase in the fourth quarter, which was partial because we had some extension of price protection for some period. But we did get an impact of some increase, but that increase was  smaller,  I  think  it  was  under  1%,  between  0.75%  and  0.8%,  something  like  that  for  the quarter. And we have taken another price increase which was recently announced in the week of April,  I  think  around  10th  April,  and  that  price  increase,  as  we  have  mentioned  in  the  stock exchanges is 1.25% average. So, that is what we have done so far. And I think the impact of fourth quarter price increase will fully also come in in the first quarter of the next year. And this new price increase impact will also come, if not for the full quarter, but most of the quarter. So, that is one.  Commodity, unfortunately commodity increase has been very, very steep. In the fourth quarter, and earlier also I mentioned in my last conference call that the bulk of the impact is going to come in the fourth quarter. So, commodity impact, if we were to look at commodity impact, it's almost close to what 400 basis points in this quarter, compared to last year same quarter. Even sequentially the impact is quite big because the impact was not so much in the third quarter as it is now. So, even think sequentially the impact will be slightly under 3%. Now, obviously, there are various things that we would do, price increase is what something we have done, but we are now  working  on  our  internal  plan  of  mitigating  the  impact  on  seeing  how  we  can  reduce improvement of yield and how we can reduce consumption of some of these precious metals and kind of make up there. Plus, as I mentioned, these two price increases also will help in partially mitigating the impact. So, these are various action points that we are doing. And we are hopeful at some point in time the commodities will stabilize, and you might also start seeing some reversal as well, where they can't indefinitely continue to keep rising. And we will take collaborative calls based on where we are at that point in time. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.	2212		2	 So, these are various action points that we are doing.  And I think the impact of fourth quarter price increase will fully also come in in the first quarter of the next year.  The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas.  Plus, as I mentioned, these two price increases also will help in partially mitigating the impact.  Even sequentially the impact is quite big because the impact was not so much in the third quarter as it is now.  And this new price increase impact will also come, if not for the full quarter, but most of the quarter.  Commodity, unfortunately commodity increase has been very, very steep. So, we took an increase in the fourth quarter, which was partial because we had some extension of price protection for some period.	increase neutral been answered there concerned changed done clear reference here invest weakening help statement continue coming good follow benefit saying said comments correct yes adjustments progress contribute forecast comment not unclear positive declined come over	complete decline increase neutral underperformed there fall changed done clear stabilizing here reference guidance invest remarks weakening show important help small reported uncertain statement say today continue figures stabilize calculations good benefit saying said comments unknown right correct rise yes adjustments inflation progress contribute forecast bearish announced changes unclear positive declined one come over
2173	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Kumar Rakesh	My best wishes and prayers for everyone on the call and their family members. My first question was for Ajay sir. So, on the margin front itself, so how much of commodity sequentially you said has already come through? And more importantly, what it appears so far is that our price increases  have  been  trailing  the  commodity  inflation  which  we  are  seeing.  And  in  the  next quarter, we will also have the ramp up impact of the new plant in Gujarat. So, would it be fair to expect that this decline in margin will likely continue at least for a quarter or two?	571		0	 And more importantly, what it appears so far is that our price increases  have  been  trailing  the  commodity  inflation  which  we  are  seeing.

2174	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	It  all  depends  on  what  the  volume  offtake  is.  Because  if  situation  continues  like  this  and deteriorates, then, of course, there will be definitely an issue of operating leverage, including the new plant that is going to come in. But the kind of hit rate that we were having in the fourth quarter, we are hopeful that we will be at least doing this, and we will actually running short of supply as we had very low inventories at the end of the year. So, hopefully, I think, if things don't deteriorate from here and they start improving thereafter, we may see things looking up and operating leverage being much better. But if they don't, then of course there is this concern of the outlook. But it will also depend on one more factor that how much more headwind do we have on commodities, because the onslaught has still not stopped. We are also seeing some rise in prices even in the first quarter. So, if at some point in time they stop, I think then you will start seeing that reversal. So, it's difficult to predict at this time what will be the outlook, but margins can be volatile at least in the first quarter or the first half of this year.	1163		2	 But it will also depend on one more factor that how much more headwind do we have on commodities, because the onslaught has still not stopped.

2175	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Kumar Rakesh	Got it. Thanks for that. My second question was Shashank, so have you done any study, or you have any understanding or your thought process around how do you take a call between price increase and its impact on their demand versus the profitability which as a company you would want to maintain? So, far it appears that we have been very conservative in taking price increase, looking at the demand, but what kind of impact that can potentially do on the demand, do you have any price elasticity or some understanding of how that plays out vis-à-vis how much of profitability loss you are okay to take in this process?	618		1	My second question was Shashank, so have you done any study, or you have any understanding or your thought process around how do you take a call between price increase and its impact on their demand versus the profitability which as a company you would want to maintain.

2176	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Yes. So, basically when we look at the price hikes, we do look at a combination of factors. So, one of the factors obviously is to look at the elasticity of demand, which you mentioned just now,  we  have  quantitative  elasticities for  different  segments,  because as you  know,  different segments elasticity to price hikes are different. Secondly, we also have to look at the volume part, because that is where the subjective judgement comes in. Because sometimes when you assume a certain volume, depending on the market situation, and there is no exact science to that, except that elasticity part if demand was only a function of price. And there is always, as you know a debate between what volumes we can achieve and how much profit we should look at. And somewhere there is a consensus which emerges that this is what is important. Sometimes the  volume  takes  precedence,  sometimes the  profitability is  also very  important. But  I  think, given the sticky nature of the market in the last two years, we have been conservative in price hikes, mainly because we think, as a market leader, it is also our duty to kick start the industry overall. And that is why when the cost of acquisition has gone up in the last couple of years, we have really been very conscious of the fact that we need to protect the volumes as well going forward, not only for Maruti Suzuki but for the industry overall as well. Thank  you.  The  next  question  is  from  the  line  of  Yogesh  Aggarwal  from  HSBC  Securities.

2178	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	No, what I am saying is that if you are able to use the third plant volume also, then you will be able to absorb the cost, that incremental cost that you are incurring there. So, while we had this constraint  in  the  fourth  quarter,  otherwise  we  could  have  produced  more  and  we  could  have delivered more, as you know our network stock was only 40,000 odd at the end of March. So, what I am saying is that if there is this demand pull, and we are able to produce high quantity, then the hit rate of the third and the fourth quarter, with a new plant coming in, then you can actually neutralize that additional impact that we have been talking about the fixed cost that will play in the current scheme of things. That is all. Otherwise, I think operating leverage has almost seen its peak in the third and fourth quarter.	831		2	No, what I am saying is that if you are able to use the third plant volume also, then you will be able to absorb the cost, that incremental cost that you are incurring there.

Suzuki talked about the mid-term plan in February, they talked about double-digit volume growth, lot more EVs in the next three, four years, but flattish margins from last year to FY 2026. So, in context of everything, would you be able to provide some clarity on what are the plans for India? And also, just a smaller point to that, you are now selling almost 6,000 cars to Toyota per month, so how do we see this over the next one, two years? And in terms of compensation, is there some sharing which can happen from a Toyota side in terms of larger vehicles? 	617		1	Sir, and the other thing is, just big picture.

2180	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Rahul Bharti	Okay. See, on the electrification and the net zero agenda, it's a large agenda. It spans not years, it spans decades. So, we have to configure our business according to that. As far as electrification is concerned, still despite many efforts by many stakeholders, the penetration is very low, it is not  even  1%  So,  the  fundamentals  have  to  be  addressed  first,  and  the  fundamentals  are localization of key components that go into the electric car or the hybrid electric car. So, you are aware we are working on such localization of parts, we have a lithium-ion cell plant. So, we will work on the fundamentals and the moment we have a viable, scalable option and offering, we would of course like to scale it up. As regards Toyota, so far, we are doing about 6,000 numbers. As and when we have more avenues, we will let you know. But what I can certainly tell you is, the partnership is working well on exports, so we are able to leverage the network in Africa and countries like that, and our exports you would have seen it in the numbers. And future should also be positive on this. Thank you. Next question is from the line of Raghunandan from Emkay Global. Please go ahead. First question was to Shashank. On retail market share, would it be over 50% in FY 2021, if I also include the sales of Toyota? And also, global Suzuki had indicated in February that India market share, the aspiration is to hold on to 50% over the medium-term, if you can add some colour on efforts to sustain the market share. My second question is, can you share the first-time replacement and additional buyer mix for a FY 2021? Also, by when would you expect some kind of recovery to pan out on the replacement demand side?	1718		1	 Also, by when would you expect some kind of recovery to pan out on the replacement demand side.

2181	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	So, on your first question on the retail market share. As you know, this data is generally shared across in the industry. It's not a definitive data. However, from the current available information, Maruti Suzuki's retail market share is just under 50% on its own. And yes, if you add Glanza and Urban Cruiser to that number, it does cross in fact 51% for the financial year 2020-2021. On the other question about the market profile, as far as the first-time buyer and the replacement buying is concerned, the first-time buying, as we have been repeatedly saying, has gone up by about 3.5%. And additional car buying has also gone up by almost the same percentage, it is about 3.6%. And the additional car buying is what has come down from I think 26.4% to 19.5%. So,  the  first-time  buyer,  going  up  from  43.4%  to  46.9%,  up  by  3.5%.  Replacement  buying coming down 26.4% to 19.5%, which is almost 7%. Additional car buying going up from 30.1% to 33.7%. There seemed to have been a little bounce back in Q4 for replacement buying, but we find again in this month the replacement buying in that range of around 18%. So, I am not sure replacement buying is actually quite closely related to the sentiments, again, because people will tend to hold back to their older vehicles and not upgrade if they are not sure of the situation. So, I think it's difficult to predict when the replacement car buying will come down to the previous levels. But I think we did find that when the thing became a little more normal in Q3 and early part of Q4, the replacement buying was coming very close to that figure of 25%. Thank  you,  sir.  That  was  very  helpful.  I  had  also  asked,  like  global  Suzuki  had  indicated aspiration to sustain 50% share over the next five years, and in the February presentation they had indicated efforts on SUVs, CNG and strengthening of sales infrastructure. So, if you can add some colour on efforts to sustain that 50% or the dominant mark over the medium term? Thank you.	2011		2	 And the additional car buying is what has come down from I think 26.  On the other question about the market profile, as far as the first-time buyer and the replacement buying is concerned, the first-time buying, as we have been repeatedly saying, has gone up by about 3.  And yes, if you add Glanza and Urban Cruiser to that number, it does cross in fact 51% for the financial year 2020-2021.  So, I am not sure replacement buying is actually quite closely related to the sentiments, again, because people will tend to hold back to their older vehicles and not upgrade if they are not sure of the situation. 5%.  As you know, this data is generally shared across in the industry.  Replacement  buying coming down 26. 5%, which is almost 7%. So, on your first question on the retail market share. 4% to 19.  I  had  also  asked,  like  global  Suzuki  had  indicated aspiration to sustain 50% share over the next five years, and in the February presentation they had indicated efforts on SUVs, CNG and strengthening of sales infrastructure.	buying behind acquisitions decline drop increase there purchases fall concerned grow changed done clear invest sales buy unchanged help money reported continue figures mixed good saying concerns said comments data right sell correct rise yes worried progress bearish numbers down not unclear positive over	buying estimates acquisitions decline increase cautious underperformed happened there purchases fall concerned grow changed clear negative stabilizing invest remarks weakening unchanged help rising sense uncertain statement figures calculations mixed good benefit saying concerns said comments data right correct forecasts yes rise worried intact progress report contribute forecast bearish numbers down comment not unclear positive declined history over
2182	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Yes. So, I think that 50% is sort of a figure which we look at whenever we are looking at industry size and how much is the projections and what Maruti needs to do to attain that sort of market share. So, if there isn't any indication, if you look at figures for last year, for example, 2020- 2021, the market share for Maruti Suzuki in the passenger car segment, which is A segment, is almost 63%. In C, which is the van segment, it is now 97.3%, up by 7.7%. In MPV, the market share is 56.9%, again, up by 7%. So, without the SUV the market share is 64%, it is up by 1% over last year. However, when you look at the overall picture with the SUV, and that is where I think the issue is, our market share is just 13.2%, although we are the market leader by far, as far as the entry SUV is concerned. In the mid SUV, I think the S-Cross' performance has been suboptimal. That is where our market share gets pulled down from 64% without SUV to 48% last year, if you include the SUV. So, I think it's clear, we need to focus on our products plan in that segment. And we are obviously looking at those white spaces, and also those red spaces I keep talking about where our market share is low. But also continuing our dominance, including in the fuel efficiency and the part where CNG has come out as a very good option. As was being mentioned by Ajay Seth in his opening remarks, CNG has also proved to be a great source of good market share for us. So, I think these are some of the factors which we take into account. And  obviously,  it  has  to  be  backed  up  not  only  with  product  plans,  but  with  our  network expansion as well, which we continue to do, and in our overall plan so that we keep the high market shares, which was indicated in the Suzuki's press conference. Thank  you.  Next  question  is  from  the  line  of  Jinesh  Gandhi  from  Motilal  Oswal  Financial Services. Please go ahead.	1911		2	 In C, which is the van segment, it is now 97. 7%.

But also, going forward, even after the disruptions are over,  you  will  find  that  the  consumer  preference  to  come  on  the  digital  platform  across  the country  would  increase.  So,  we  see  it  as  an  irreversible  trend  and  that  is  why  we  have strengthened it so much over the last few years.	750		2	So, as far as the total enquiry levels are concerned, the contribution last year was about 35% on the digital platform.

We have taken whatever measures we could take in terms of ensuring alternate suppliers or rejigging the model mix, etc. Whatever it was under our control, we have done that. But moving forward, with the current condition of COVID, etc., how will it pan out, what will happen is difficult to predict. So,  far,  we  have  been  able  to  manage  it.  But  it's  very  difficult  to  give  you  an  answer  and assurance on whether it will be seamless or there could be some disruption. So, it will depend on how these suppliers behave, because obviously some quantity is getting shifted to priority, and therefore the production  has come down for auto. But I mean, it started happening quite some time back, we have been able to manage it so far. Let's see and if there is any problem then, of course, we keep communicating from time to time. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sonal Gupta from UBS. Please go ahead. I had a couple of questions.

2212	\maruti\mar-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Yes. That's right. So, the short answer is, yes, I think the customer does distinguish between the two. However, this SUV customer in India is a little different from what you find in Europe or Latin America, or U.S., in the sense that ours is largely a two wheel drive. So, it's not used really for off-roading. But the stance of riding that it provides, the big ground clearance, the larger tires, those are the things which the customer is looking for in an SUV. And I think the customer is able to distinguish between a crossover and the SUV.	546		1	So, the short answer is, yes, I think the customer does distinguish between the two.

However, I must say that if you further dissect that in the entry-SUV, of course, we are the market leaders with Brezza. So, is it a mid-SUV? Premium-SUV segment is actually very small, contributing to just 0.8% of the overall sales. Whereas the entry-SUV and the mid-SUV which are larger, 16.4% entry-SUV and 14.7% mid-SUV. In the mid-SUV, our market share is actually quite low, even though Brezza is a leading in the entry-SUV. In the mid-SUV we have the S-Cross, which we  recently  launched  with  a  new  engine  in  August.  And  I  think  it  has  given  us  suboptimal numbers so far, which we intend to increase in the coming years. Of course, as far as the overall product plan for SUVs is concerned, as I mentioned, we keep looking at those red and white spots. White if there is an opening, red where we are poor. So, yes, we will have a product plan, but I am really constrained, I really can't speak about the future product plan in that segment. But yes, we are cognizant of the fact and we are looking at this segment very, very carefully. And definitely we will see some action there.	1298		0	4% entry-SUV and 14.

The country is again witnessing an uptick in number of COVID-19 cases in certain regions. We are closely monitoring the development and taking all precautionary steps in the best interest of the employees' health and safety including that of our value chain partners. Let me start with some highlights of financial year 2021-22; the company launched two new products,  new-Baleno  and  new-Celerio.  Besides 
the  highly 
fuel-efficient  powertrain 
the Company also offered many industry first technological features in the compact segment cars, such  as  heads  up  display,  telematics,  360o  camera,  hill  hold  assist  to  improve  customer convenience  and  safety.  In  the  new-Baleno  the  increased  fuel  efficiency  coupled  with  the introduction of many technological features that will increase its acceptability. Since its launch in February‘22 new Baleno has received more than 80,000 bookings. During the year, the Company also launched product refreshers in Wagon-R and extended its CNG product lineup with the introduction of Dzire CNG. The year saw customer preferences of CNG  vehicles 
increasing  further.  The  Company's  sold  over  230,000  CNG  vehicles  and registered highest ever sales for the CNG vehicles in any financial year. The Company continues to be the most preferred car brand in the country. In financial year ‘21-22, 8 of the top 10 best- commemorates its 40th year since its inception. Thank you. We are ready to take your questions suggestions. Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Raghunandan NL from Emkay Global. Firstly, on the order book side, can you indicate what would be the current order book? I think media  has  been  indicating  around  326,000.  Also,  can  you  share  what  was  the  retails  in  last quarter? My second question was your peers have started launching hybrids, would you be going ahead with hybrid launches in future, would your upcoming SUV's have hybrid options?"	2121		2	" The first question is from the line of Raghunandan NL from Emkay Global.

Hybrids  are  a  very  powerful  technology,  which  can  work  in conjunction along with EVs to help reduce carbon and reduce oil import. They do about 30%- 40% of the job of an EV and are many times more scalable. It would be an interesting option and we’ll be looking forward to such technologies in the future.

As commodities have firmed up, so we find increase in the steel cost because the demand from steel buyers is significantly higher at this point in time. But it is under negotiation. We find that the precious metals, which had gone up immediately after the war, have kind of settled down. But there are concerns largely on steel and some other commodities like aluminium, copper etc. So, it is difficult to give you a guidance at this point in time. We are waiting and watching and it will also depend on how demand and supply pans out in the near future.

In terms of geographies, Africa turned out to be a  #1 market,  and  the  numbers  have  been  going  good.  The  positive  part  is  that  these  levels  are sustainable.

2277	\maruti\mar-23.pdf	Ajay Seth	Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen, In its 40th anniversary year, despite the shortage of electronic components, the Company recorded its highest- ever annual sales volume. The annual turnover of the Company surpassed Rupees ONE LAKH crore mark. Financial year 2022-23 was also an action-packed year for the Company. It worked on multiple fronts. Among other  things,  it  introduced  three new  models,  four  product  refreshers,  one of  the  world’s best  Strong  Hybrid Electric technology, six-speed automatic transmission technology, and a host of new-age technology features. Additionally, the Company extended the CNG powertrain to six models, ensured that its entire portfolio complied with  new  regulations/norms,  started  construction  of  a  new  manufacturing  facility,  demonstrated  an  electric vehicle  concept,  enhanced  its  manufacturing  flexibility  to  accommodate  market  fluctuations,  maximised  the production volume amidst shortage of electronic components, and expanded the digitalisation drive. The Company strengthened its product portfolio in the SUV segment with the launch of Brezza and Grand Vitara, thereby increasing its market share in this segment. Moving forward, with Jimny and Fronx, the SUV product portfolio  of  the  Company  will  be  further  strengthened.  With  this,  the  Company  aims  to  secure  a  leadership position in the SUV segment. The  Brezza  and  the  flagship  SUV  Grand  Vitara  garnered  strong  bookings  since  their  introduction.  The phenomenal success of Brezza and Grand Vitara stands as the testimony of Company’s ability to command a larger volume in higher-price segment vehicles. The Company believes in offering products and technologies that are relevant to the Indian market context. Through extensive market research, the Company gathered that in During the period, the Company registered Net Sales of  INR 1,125,008 million compared with INR 837,981 million in FY2021-22. The Company recorded an Operating Profit of INR 81,844 million in FY2022-23 as against INR 29,147 million in FY2021-22. The Company was able to better its operating profit on account of higher sales volume, improved realization from the market, and favourable forex movement. With this, the Net Profit for the year rose to INR 80,492 million, which is the highest-ever. The Net Profit in FY2021-22 was at INR 37,663 million. The Board of Directors recommended highest-ever dividend of INR 90 per share (face value of INR 5 per share) compared to INR 60 per share in FY 2021-22. We are now ready to take your questions, feedback and any other observations that you may have. Thank you. Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Kapil Singh from Nomura. Please go ahead.	2801		2	 Additionally, the Company extended the CNG powertrain to six models, ensured that its entire portfolio complied with  new  regulations/norms,  started  construction  of  a  new  manufacturing  facility,  demonstrated  an  electric vehicle  concept,  enhanced  its  manufacturing  flexibility  to  accommodate  market  fluctuations,  maximised  the production volume amidst shortage of electronic components, and expanded the digitalisation drive.

2281	\maruti\mar-23.pdf	Rahul Bharti	Yes, I am fully with you. We feel the loss of production because of supply side bottlenecks, semiconductors. The problem is a global one and it is due to a combination of factors such as a particular supplier, a particular plant, a particular country, a particular design of a model. So, basis the combination it could affect different models, different manufacturers, different modules of the car differently. All our efforts are to organize supplies through multiple sources. We are also doing depopulation for example if there is a particular semiconductor in a particular variant of a model which is superfluous, which is not required, sometimes because of commonization you keep it. We  are removing all such semiconductors. So that our consumption is the  minimum. All those efforts are going in including negotiations at global scales. However, we are still vulnerable to supply side bottlenecks.	903		1	We feel the loss of production because of supply side bottlenecks, semiconductors.

2283	\maruti\mar-23.pdf	Ajay Seth	Discounts during the quarter (Q4 FY2022-23) was at INR 13,269 per vehicle, they were lower than the 3rd Quarter (Q3 FY2022-23) and they were slightly higher than Q4 previous year (Q4 FY2021-22) was at INR 11,130 per vehicle.  Q3  FY2022-23  was  higher  at  INR  18,291  per  vehicle.  So,  the  raw  material  to  net  sales  (ratio)  is  a combination of many factors. The proportion of sales of products manufactured both at SMG and at Toyota has gone up. There the concept of transfer pricing works, fixed cost of theirs’ is loaded on to the material cost. So, while you are seeing absolute profits have gone up, as a percentage there will be slight change. Because if that proportion of products from SMG and Toyota is higher, then of course the load of overheads also goes into the material cost due to the transfer price. So, that is the main reason. But  other  than that,  the  raw  material  prices  have  pretty  much  remained  constant  and  there  has  not  been  any significant change. Discounts have in fact come down compared to the 3rd Quarter. And foreign exchange rates also have been stable, in fact Yen was at 140 per USD in the 2nd Quarter, it is now slightly deteriorated to about 132-134 per USD, so there would be some impact of the foreign exchange as well, but not significant. So, I think these are the factors that have resulted in the ratio that you see as it reflects in the quarterly account and full year accounts. Thank you. Next question is from the line of Pramod Kumar from UBS. Please go ahead.	1534		0	 Because if that proportion of products from SMG and Toyota is higher, then of course the load of overheads also goes into the material cost due to the transfer price.

What has been the kind of jump in the average consumption of semis for you because the market has a difficulty in believing that we have been continuously plagued with the semiconductor shortage over more than a full year now and it’s not expected to resolve anytime soon but just want to understand within Maruti, given the model mix,  what you enjoy currently, what has been the kind of semiconductor intensity increase what you have seen on the year-on-year basis, on the per model basis the average semiconductor numbers what you had earlier, what is it now so that we can better appreciate the kind of scale of issues of what you are facing. And the second question was on the demand for the entry level car segment. We continue to see that category continues to shrink. So according to you, where do you think demand could settle on the lower side for that segment? And what will be needed from a macro perspective for that segment of first-time buyers, an entry level car buyers to kind of make up for that.	1261		1	My question is a follow-up to what Kapil asked, if you can just help us understand because of the kind of changes in  the  models  we  have  done,  the  kind  of  feature  enhancement  what  you  are  planning  and  the  changes  to transmission.

2285	\maruti\mar-23.pdf	Rahul Bharti	On  the  first  question,  yes,  because  of  higher  functionality,  premium  features,  technology,  infotainment,  the semiconductor content in the car has gone up. It’s difficult to put a number because it’s a model wise, variant wise  phenomenon.  Having  said  that,  globally  also  one  of  the  reasons,  one  of  the  drivers  of  semiconductor consumption is increase in larger cars and some EVs in Europe also. So, I think all manufacturers are affected, everybody complains about semiconductor shortages, everybody has pending bookings, so it’s an industry wide phenomenon. And  one  element  that  sometimes  hurts  more  is  that  when  semiconductor  manufacturers  peg  the  new  year allocations based on past base figures so that sometimes works to disadvantage. On your second question. So, this year entry level cars in FY2022-23 were higher than in the previous year, with a reasonably good growth.

And this year we will also have ESC (Electronic Stability Control) that will have a minor cost impact and will have seatbelt reminders that will also have a minor cost impact. Other than that, we don’t see any regulatory impact this year. In CAFE we are the best, we have the least CO2 among all the car manufacturers in India, we have the cleanest fleet with the lowest CO2 value. And I do believe that not all are in a similar comfortable position.

2299	\maruti\mar-23.pdf	Rahul Bharti	See, sometimes we use terms interchangeably when we say greener shift, the green is in the CO2 value. Maruti Suzuki has the least CO2 emissions among all car manufacturers in India. For the simple reason that it is not just 1% of your portfolio which contributes to the CO2, it’s the balance 99% also. So, the entire portfolio, all the volume of sales have to have a lower total CO2 that’s how the green shift happens. Now coming to your question about EV in shared mobility, we will be launching our EV next financial year, which is FY2024-25. And the specifications are quite powerful 550 km range, 60 kWh battery size and very competitive charging time also.

2300	\maruti\mar-23.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, commodity is a mix bag. As you have said that some of the precious metals have corrected, the impact comes with a lag effect. So, as we mentioned there is a quarter lag in the impact that’s captured. But there are certain other commodities which have also see an uptick. So, it’s a combination of all that you would have to see, but yes you are right, Rhodium and Palladium have seen some correction from the levels that they were at. I think for us the biggest commodity still remains as steel, where we have been told by our supply chain team that moving forward, they are seeing some increase in prices given that demand is picking up now. So, that’s something that we need to watch because half of the commodity basket is steel, and the balance half is the other commodities. So, I think it’s a combination of all, so the impact of this, if any will be captured in the Q1 FY2023- 24, but it will have to be seen along with all other commodities put together. For FY'23 if you could give some color in terms of customer mix how has it been for rural versus urban, first time buyer, additional buyer and replacement buyer, how has that changed, which segments are doing well?	1181		2	 So, I think it’s a combination of all, so the impact of this, if any will be captured in the Q1 FY2023- 24, but it will have to be seen along with all other commodities put together.

And  the  last  word,  on  technology,  the  auto  industry  is  going  through  a  major  transformation,  it’s  not  just technology, its business models also.

And we have seen a significant uptake in terms of increase in the penetration through that portal. So, all these digitization initiatives that have been going on in the marketing are really paying off and this is one of them in terms of giving them a platform where they can compete, financiers can compete for offering the best rates to our customer with their credit profiles.

Let  us  start  with  some  of  recent  business  highlights/  milestones,  The  most  notable aspect  this  year  was  a  record  growth  in  Exports.  Export  sales  were  the  highest  ever  in  the Company’s history and the figures of the first half this year exceeded the full year sales of last year.  We rolled out Maruti Suzuki Smart Finance across India, an industry first initiative. It now covers diverse customer profiles. During the quarter, over 1 lakh loans have been disbursed to customers  using  this  platform.  This  is  a  testimony  of  customer  acceptance.  With  focus  to improve  customer  convenience  and  experience,  Maruti  Suzuki  rolled  out  “S-ASSIST”  an industry-first  AI  (Artificial  Intelligence)  based  24x7  virtual  car  assistant  app.  The  App  is developed by “Xane.AI” a start-up under the company’s MAIL initiative to nurture innovation. We extended advanced intelligent telematics technology, Suzuki Connect, for the vehicles in ARENA  channel  also.  Suzuki  Connect  offers  connected  car  experience  to  Maruti  Suzuki  car owners. The Company, launched ‘Kam Se Kaam Banega’, a campaign to celebrate three decades of leadership in offering country’s most  fuel-efficient cars. Maruti Suzuki over the years has offered country’s most fuel-efficient cars across all segments. Working in close partnership with the parent company Suzuki Motor Corporation, Japan, Maruti Suzuki is committed to promote environmentally  friendly  products.

So, there’s an impact of depreciation, that’s been charged on that plant. And the second is the fixed cost that’s being incurred on that plant. Obviously, because of chip shortage, the utilization has not been to what we had expected. Therefore, the fixed cost that we are carrying on these two accounts, which is depreciation, where the run rate or the new plant depreciation would be about INR 500 crores a year. So, you can divide it to take a quarterly figure and the fixed cost I don’t have the fixed cost number right away with me, but there will be  a  moderate  amount  of  fixed  cost  although  which  has  been  incurred  there,  but  these  two impacts are the ones that will negate ones the volumes pickup.	842		1	 So, you can divide it to take a quarterly figure and the fixed cost I don’t have the fixed cost number right away with me, but there will be  a  moderate  amount  of  fixed  cost  although  which  has  been  incurred  there,  but  these  two impacts are the ones that will negate ones the volumes pickup.

There is  some  preferential  rate  in  the  GST  and  some  FAME  benefit  to  strong  hybrids  and  plug  in hybrids, but we need more. And to your other question, will it be a meaningful mainstream kind of option for the country, yes, we believe so, in the next 5-10 years, at least it will be a very potent option for reducing CO2. A hybrid does 40% of the job of an electric and it is scalable as it does not need charging infrastructure. We need more benefits from the government.	575		2	 And to your other question, will it be a meaningful mainstream kind of option for the country, yes, we believe so, in the next 5-10 years, at least it will be a very potent option for reducing CO2.

2356	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, there are two parts to it, Kapil, one is of course, it depends on how the volumes now pan out because we’ve been affected on operating leverage because of volumes, so if volume improves and then definitely we will have benefit. We have seen some softening of precious metals in Q2, but since we get into the lag effect, so we are hopeful that in quarter3, we will see some softening at least for the precious metals if they don’t again start moving up. So, whatever action we can take in terms of hedging we will be taking. Unfortunately, aluminum and steel doesn’t look good at this point in time. We were hoping that that will also soften but it looks like given the China issue, it looks like that the prices will either be here or may rise again for steel and aluminum. We will have to keep a watch on these developments, we continue to make our own efforts in terms of what we can do with other mitigation plans and cost reduction plans, those efforts are on. But two important things for us would be, watch the commodity prices moving forward and the volumes. The other thing that I would like to also mention is that we did a price increase in first week of September. So, that will be fully absorbed into third quarter as that impact wouldn’t have been completely visible in the second quarter. So, that will also help. Thank you. We have next question from the line of Gunjan Prithyani from Bank of America. Please go ahead.	1437		2	So, there are two parts to it, Kapil, one is of course, it depends on how the volumes now pan out because we’ve been affected on operating leverage because of volumes, so if volume improves and then definitely we will have benefit.

Firstly, on the follow up on margin, can you give us more color on what is the impact of commodity on a sequential basis, because Gujarat was part of quarter1 cost as well. So, incrementally, its essentially commodity hit. And also, you call out this increase in advertisement and promotional spends in this quarter what does this pertain to, given we really don’t have launches and discounts are very low in the market?	448		1	Firstly, on the follow up on margin, can you give us more color on what is the impact of commodity on a sequential basis, because Gujarat was part of quarter1 cost as well.

2358	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	So,  effectively  the  significant  impact  has  been  on  commodities,  as  we  mentioned  that  our material costs to net sales ratio has moved up by about 6.4%. Now, that is a huge impact, in spite of the small price increase that we have taken and also the cost reduction measures that we have taken during the period. So, the impact of, so you can imagine that the impact of commodities is much more than this 6.4% increase that you see, this is after netting off all the other measures that the Company has taken. The quarter2 impact is also maximum because the precious metal prices were at its peak in quarter one, and we always get a lag effect of these commodity costs. Therefore, I mentioned that, given the current trend of precious metal cost, quarter3 or moving forward looks better if there was not to be an increase in this. So, we will have to keep watching in terms of where the market moves in commodity. But we will also have to accordingly decide what are the steps that a Company needs to take if commodities either remain here or go up in terms of corrective measures that are required to be taken.	1121		2	4%.

2364	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Rahul Bharti	"Okay. On the fuel price increase, how’s the market responding, I’ll request Head of Marketing and Sales Mr. Shashank to respond on the other two questions I’ll take. See there are two broad regulations which are coming up. One is the CAFE phase2 and the second is BS-VI phase2. BS- VI phase2 involves a clause on real driving emissions, because of which we think there will be an  impact  mostly  on diesel  powertrain  cost  to  comply  with  that. So,  on  CAFE  also  different manufacturers will have different strategies of meeting it, because there are so many options of reducing your CO2 output. Maruti is positioned the best because we have the least CO2 emission as a portfolio. And since it is just around the corner, we are expecting it from 1st of April 22 we have to meet the norms. And in terms of the powertrain the options that you talked about. So, while  there  are  some  EV  launches,  but  the  volumes  are  quite  miniscule,  and  they  don’t  add meaningfully 
to 
the  CO2  reduction.  So,  we  need  some 
technology  which  addresses 
the mainstream for example, natural gas, it does a 25% CO2 reduction and is scalable across India and the government also wants it. It’s a clean fuel, there is no particulate matter, its customer friendly,  the  market  seems  to  absorb  it  well.  So, that  is  why  we  are  pitching  on  natural  gas. Hybrid electric vehicles are also very good because they don’t need charging infrastructure to scale up, they have some cost impact but it is lesser than that of EVs and similarly they have about a 40% CO2 benefit. So, this churn will happen in most car companies in the next 5-10 years. And we have to work with options which are best for the customer, and which gives us good cost efficiency also. So, on question related to market impact because of increase in fuel prices may I request Shashank san."	1872		1	" BS- VI phase2 involves a clause on real driving emissions, because of which we think there will be an  impact  mostly  on diesel  powertrain  cost  to  comply  with  that.

2365	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Yes, so directionally of course increased fuel prices increase the cost of running, and that’s a negative as far as demand is concerned. However, what we have found is, that the demand for the CNG vehicles have increased dramatically, possibly because of two reasons. One is increased gap  between  the  CNG  fuel  price  and  the  gasoline diesel  price,  which  means  that  the  cost  of running for CNG roughly around INR.1.60-Rs.1.70 per kilometer against INR. 5 per kilometer for a diesel or a petrol. So, that is one reason why it has gone up. And the second reason is, of course  because  the  CNG  infrastructure  has  dramatically  spread.  Thanks  to  support  from  the government. Now, we are covering almost 250 cities with 3800 odd stations as against just 3-4 years back of about 1400 stations covering 150 cities. So, directionally I think that will continue. And as Mr.Bharti explained going forward, the mix of hybrid and CNG is going to help and Maruti is very well placed as regards that.	1009		2	 So, directionally I think that will continue.  5 per kilometer for a diesel or a petrol.

2375	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	So, if you look at the increase in prices, you’re right there has been an increase overall in the industry and for Maruti Suzuki as well. As you know, we have had three price hikes this year, the demand seems to be stable. In fact, if you look at the average enquiry or the booking levels have actually gone up. And that got something to do with the change in consumer preference for personal mobility, against shared mobility or public transport. What are we going to do about it and have we seen any changes segment wise, we do see segment wise changes but it may not entirely be related to cost of acquisition. The entry hatches have gone down a little bit, they are now about 10% of the market as against 11% two years back, SUVs have gone up especially the Entry SUV and the Mid SUV. So, there seems to be a preference not just based on the economics or the cost of acquisition, but also on the design preference and that’s what we see, going forward also we predict a similar sort of movement in the SUV sector. And yes, we are watching that space very carefully that’s one of the spots which we shall look at very carefully going forward. Thank you.

2377	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	If you divide those segments Of course the one, the earlier answer pertains to the type of vehicle segments. now you’re also asking about demographic, the type of buying itself. So, the first- time buyers have remained pretty steady. For its roughly around 40%45%, -46% that has been. Secondly, the replacement buying which was earlier 26%, a couple of years back has come down to about 19.6%. But it’s slightly up over last year, the additional car buying has gone up from about 30% in 2019-20 to about 35.2% in this year. So, this is by the buyer type, if you want of course we have many other types, not sure whether we can go through the entire list. But the average age has come down a little from about 40 years to about 38.5 now for Maruti Suzuki vehicles. Average MHI actually have gone up a little bit and if you’re talking about those salaried business, self-employed type of consumers, we’ve seen a drop as far as the salaried consumers are concerned over last year, last year it had gone up suddenly from 43% in 2019-20 to 49% in 2020-21 it has drop back to that 40- 43% level and the business class customer has actually gone down from about 33% in 2019-20 to about 29% now. So, that is the roughly the breakup if you want in terms of the occupation. I am sure you would like to know about the gender percentage also, it has remained steady. Thank you Mr. Shashank.

So,  the  Ministry  of  road  transport  is  quite enthusiastic about flex fuel for three reasons, one it reduces oil imports, second, it reduces carbon emission and third, it will help to get farmers better realization for their crops. So, we are also looking at this option quite seriously. As of now, we do not know the technology we are studying it, but we are open about it, how it works is that any fuel you fill into the car, whether it is 100% gasoline or 100% ethanol or anywhere in between the car runs on the fuel by adjusting itself to the characteristics of the fuel. So, we are trying to understand, it is a mainstream option in Brazil. And the only issue is we do not know how much the market will be, it might be limited in some states or some areas. So, we have to study that option along with the carbon footprint of such vehicles. And accordingly, we will take a call. Your other question was about the Jimny, I will request Mr. Shashank to answer.	1027		1	 As of now, we do not know the technology we are studying it, but we are open about it, how it works is that any fuel you fill into the car, whether it is 100% gasoline or 100% ethanol or anywhere in between the car runs on the fuel by adjusting itself to the characteristics of the fuel.

2407	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Yes, so we have been studying that consumer profile for CNG.

So, here we haven’t seen any  big  difference  in  terms  of  profile  across  the  different  criteria  whether  buyer  type  or  the occupation wise or the usage wise. So, it does appear that almost all consumers in our country are quite conscious with the running cost, and which is what is the very positive thing about CNG usage. On your second question of the volumes, the volumes for CNG for Maruti Suzuki have been increasing dramatically, roughly about 75,000 units /year till 17-18 ~105,000 units in each 18-19 and 19-20, 158,000 units in 2021 and this year, we are projecting around 300,000.

2409	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Yes, it’s a great question. And the reason I say that is, because there seems to be two types of CNG vehicles, which are coming for resale, one is the factory fitted types, and the other is the retrofitted types. The retrofitted CNG which are coming in the market have that problem that you’re referring to, because there are concerns about safety of retro fitment, there is concern about the engine, the life and the maintenance cost and that was actually also one of the fears which consumers had when the retro fitment was being done, but when the factory fitted CNG vehicles, there is no such concern and the used car prices  for CNG is actually a little higher. Because remember, now the gap between a CNG vehicle and the corresponding petrol vehicle is around INR 90,000 and I am talking of the new car. So, that is reflected also in the used cars. So, we do find that the factory fitted CNG, the used car prices hold quite strongly. But yes, for retrofit vehicles, it does drop.	985		2	 So, that is reflected also in the used cars.

2413	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Shashank Srivastava	Yes, actually it’s an option if we know that the future supply of components is assured, which in this case is not true. So, you can theoretically have semi-finished vehicles and complete them once you receive the components, and you are right, some of the OEMs might be doing it. But the thing is that one you have to store the vehicles for a long period of time. So, unless you know that the components will be available, definitely, this may not be exactly a feasible option. But if some manufacturer may want to take a chance and keep them in that stage so that when the component comes they can be completed. Thank you. We have next question from the line of Sonal Gupta from L&T Mutual Fund. Please go ahead. Sir could I get the retail volumes for the second quarter?	773		1	Yes, actually it’s an option if we know that the future supply of components is assured, which in this case is not true.

So, for Maruti Suzuki Q2 retails were about 385,000 units. Okay. And in the export point, since you’re selling a lot through the Toyota network as well, I just want to understand how does the pricing work there in the sense that one is selling to them from  India  so  we  don’t  really  have  any  Forex  risk.  And  the  second  thing  is  given  the  huge commodity cost increase,  are we able to pass that on or even there you  would be seeing that margin pressure and the prices will revise with a lag?	653		1	 And in the export point, since you’re selling a lot through the Toyota network as well, I just want to understand how does the pricing work there in the sense that one is selling to them from  India  so  we  don’t  really  have  any  Forex  risk.

2415	\maruti\sep-21.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, in case of exports, we do take into account any commodity price increase that’s taking place and we do make corrections so that periodically to ensure the margins are protected. And also, the  exchange  rates  will  have  something  to  play  on  price  depending  on  what  rate  we  had contracted and what rate we actually ended up supplying them at. So, a combination of the two, but we make sure that we protect the cost increases and the margins in the case of exports. Right. And on a longer term maybe, I don’t think we can sort of tackle this commodity price increase on a one or two quarter basis. But, unless you really expect that commodities will come all the way back down, we will significantly hit because of these pressures. So, like how do you see that do you see yourself gradually taking price increases every quarter 1% to 2% and passing all these on to the consumer or like what is the way forward here?	929		1	 And on a longer term maybe, I don’t think we can sort of tackle this commodity price increase on a one or two quarter basis.

Let me start with some business highlights during the quarter. Maruti Suzuki celebrated ‘40 years of Suzuki’s partnership with the people of India’. During the event, Hon’ble Prime Minister laid foundation stone of Suzuki Motor Gujarat electric vehicle  battery  manufacturing 
facility  at  Hansalpur,  Gujarat  and  Maruti  Suzuki  vehicle manufacturing facility in Kharkhoda, Haryana. The Company was incorporated to provide cars for the masses of India and also build a vibrant manufacturing Industry in India. We are happy to share that the Company has been true to its reason for existence even today. If  we  look back,  one  of  the  key success  factors  in  our  journey  has  been  the  strong  focus  on understanding  and  fulfilling 
the  needs  of  customers  by  offering 
them  relevant  products, technologies,  and  services.  Over 
the  years,  customers  have  evolved  and  accordingly  our products, services, and business processes too have aligned, keeping the customers at the heart of it.

Our parent Suzuki, Japan, has been a silent support, trying to look at	"    In September, the Company started retailing its newest flagship offering from NEXA, the  Grand  Vitara.  With  over  75,000  bookings  in  a  short  span  of  time,  customer response  for  Grand  Vitara  is  overwhelming.  The  Grand  Vitara  is  a  multi-product offering with cutting-edge Intelligent Electric Hybrid powertrain, Progressive Smart Hybrid technology and Suzuki ALLGRIP SELECT technology is designed to appeal to a varied customer base and will revolutionize the SUV space in India. In August, the Company launched a full model change of its iconic brand Alto. The All-New  Alto  K10 
is 
loaded  with  host  of  comfort, 
safety,  convenience  and connectivity features. The Company further strengthened its green vehicles’ portfolio by introducing S-CNG powertrain technology in Swift and S-Presso. With this, Maruti Suzuki now offers 10 vehicles  with 
factory-fitted  S-CNG 
technology.  Maruti  Suzuki’s  Research  & Development  facility  conducts  rigorous  testing  for  its  factory-fitted  S-CNG  cars  to deliver unmatched safety, performance, durability and fuel efficiency.              by acute shortage of electronic components and consequently the Company could sell a total of 379,541 units comprising 320,133 units in domestic and 59,408 units in export markets. Pending customer orders stood at about 412,000 vehicles at the end of this quarter out of which about 130,000 vehicle pre-bookings are for recently launched models. During the quarter, the Company registered its highest-ever quarterly Net Sales of INR 285,435 million. During the same period previous year, the Net Sales were at INR 192,978 million. The Operating Profit in quarter 2 FY2022-23 stood at INR 20,463 million as against INR 988 million  in  quarter  2  FY2021-22.  The  Operating  Profit  in  Q2 of  last  year  had  dipped  sharply owing  to  steep  commodity  price  increases  and  electronic  component  supply  constraints  and hence results of Q2 FY2022-23 are not strictly comparable with those of Q2 FY2021-22. The Company has been making simultaneous efforts in securing electronic components availability, cost reduction and improving realization from the market to better its margins. With this, the Net Profit for the quarter rose to INR 20,615 million from INR 4,753 million in Q2 FY2021-22. Coming to the Highlights of H1 (April-September), FY 2022-23 The Company sold a total of 985,326 units during the period. Sales in the domestic market stood at 852,694 units. Exports in this half year were at 132,632 units. During the same period previous year which is H1 FY2021-22, the Company registered a total sale of 733,155 units including 628,228  units  in  domestic  market  and  104,927  units  in  the  export  market.  In  addition  to electronic components shortage, the sales in H1 FY2021-22 were also severely affected due to COVID related disruptions and hence results of H1 FY2022-23 cannot be compared with those of H1 FY2021-22. The  Company  registered  Net  Sales  of  INR  538,298  million  in  H1  FY2022-23,  which  is  the highest-ever  half-yearly  Net  Sales.    The  Net  Sales  in  H1  FY2021-22  were  at  INR  360,965 million. The Company made a Net Profit of INR 30,743 million in the H1 FY2022-23 as against INR 9,161 million in H1 FY2021-22.

2419	\maruti\sep-22.pdf	Kumar Rakesh	My  first  question  was  around  realization.  So,  sequentially,  we  have  seen  an  increase  in  the realization by about 2%. Now, this is quite noteworthy given that in the context of the volume mix which we had during the quarter, mini and compact segments mix had increased while UVs and export mix or the volume mix was lower. And also discounting in September quarter usually is higher than what happens in the June quarter. So, despite all of this, we have seen an increase in realization. So, can you please help us understand that what led to this realization increase?	582		2	My  first  question  was  around  realization.

2420	\maruti\sep-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	Sequentially,  there  is  an  improvement  in  realization  and  this  is  attributed  to  again  the  mix because while we had lauched the new Alto, the price point of the old Alto and new Alto were different. So, that's one part. Second also, I think the proportion of the Brezza and other high- end vehicles were higher compared to the first quarter, which led to this higher realization. Also the fact that we had taken a price increase in the first quarter, which was partial in first quarter and fully absorbed in the second quarter. So, that also had its impact. Discounts are more or less same in the 2 quarters. It’s marginally higher in this quarter compared to first quarter, not very different.	706		2	Sequentially,  there  is  an  improvement  in  realization  and  this  is  attributed  to  again  the  mix because while we had lauched the new Alto, the price point of the old Alto and new Alto were different.

And in the past with portfolio being the smaller cars and we were not present in the SUV segment, still our profitability was reasonably good. I think it'll be a combination of what the market can absorb, where you can price your product and also, when the product matures over a period and as you localize and cost goes down, things change in that interim period. So, it will be a combination of many factors.

2428	\maruti\sep-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	So, in sequential, one thing that's built in and this is also other expenses is royalty. And with the volume going up, the royalty also as an absolute value goes up. And so there is an impact of that which  is  increased  from  Q1  to Q2,  that's  about  INR  150  crore. Then  there  is  increase  in  the advertisement and marketing costs. And as you are aware that we’ve had launches, and also we mentioned  in  the  previous  call  as  well  that  we  will  not  be  shying  away  from  investing  in marketing spend because that gives us a much longer visibility. So, that's gone up by another INR 150 crore. And also the manufacturing expenses have gone up because of the significant rise  in  the  energy  prices,  the  power  and  fuel  costs  have  significantly  gone  up.  Also,  certain activities that we were scaling down earlier, and in a normal situation, we've restarted that. So, there's an increase on that account as well. So, these are broadly the heads where it's gone up. There is a small increase in other heads, including the employee costs, which is a normal increase that you have on account of the normal increments, etc, that happens during the year. But other than that, I think there is no other factor of increase at this point in time.	1268		2	 So, there's an increase on that account as well.

There is a kind of visibility that we need for the new models, the kind of visibility that we need for existing brands and existing models.

So, they are about INR 1,000 higher than the first quarter. They were obviously much higher in the second quarter of last year. They were at about INR 18,500 in the second quarter of last year. So, that was on discount. The royalty percentage last year was at 3.5%, now it is at 3.8%.

Even on the exchange rates, we have gained there because the JPY depreciation has been steep during the quarter. So, there are combinations of factors this time now which are all positive. So, one, as I said commodities, second, I mentioned about regular cost reduction that we do and the JPY impact, overall impact of  the  currency  depreciation.

2480	\maruti\sep-22.pdf	Ajay Seth	Import  content  for  both  the  plants  would  be  similar.  There  is  no  difference  because  all  the procurement is more or less on the same basis. So, our total direct import content is about 4%. So, it will fall in that category only both the plants. Similarly, I think the other thing is the indirect import content which also would be in a similar category because the vendors are common and the material that we have buying from the vendors are basically similar vendors. So, there is no difference in terms of import content. In terms of forex, so between different currencies, there have been gains. Largely on the import and export side, on the dollar-rupee exposure, we are naturally hedged. So, we use a natural hedge route. On the dollar-yen, there have been maximum gains  in  this  quarter  compared  to  last  quarter  and  also  last  year  because  of  the  significant depreciation of the currency. And the net impact of  exchange rate, have been about INR 158 crore of gain in this quarter compared to first quarter of this year.	1053		1	 On the dollar-yen, there have been maximum gains  in  this  quarter  compared  to  last  quarter  and  also  last  year  because  of  the  significant depreciation of the currency.

2490	\maruti\sep-22.pdf	Rahul Bharti	So, you are right. Strong hybrids at the moment we have solutions in slightly bigger cars which have  room  and  the  engine  room  to  accommodate  both  the  powetrains.  It  becomes  a  bit  of  a challenge to bring them in smaller cars. But that is what Suzuki’s competence is all about. So, we’ll watch the market and to reduce carbon we have to adopt a portfolio of technologies and each technology, each model will have its own context, its cost, its volume. So, it’s a complex equation that we keep working on all the time. we’ll keep watching how we can maximize hybrid volumes in the future. Thank  you.  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  that  was  the  last  question  for  today.  And  with  this  we conclude today’s conference call. On behalf of Maruti Suzuki India Limited, we thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.	847		1	 On behalf of Maruti Suzuki India Limited, we thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.
