Thank you, the next question is from Jochelle Mendonca from ET Prime. Jochelle has sent a
question on text, and I am going to read it out. Jochelleâ€™s question is for you, Salil. On the revenue
per employee, Jochelle asks, revenue per employee has risen from a year ago what is driving that
and what is the breakup between net new and renewals in large deals?
Salil Parekh
The revenue per employee is a very good indicator which shows how our digital work is changing.
We do not separate in any other parameter so this gives a good indication that the more digital we
are doing, the more our revenue per employee will go up and with that now growing at 40% and
sitting at a very high level is what is reflecting in some of the parameters. In terms of net new in
the large deals our net new was 44% in the large deal and so again that gives us a good level of
confidence that this continues revenue growth momentum as we look ahead in the future.
