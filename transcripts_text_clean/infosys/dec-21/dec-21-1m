Rishi BasuThank you. The next question is from Veena Mani from Deccan Herald. And Veena also sent her
question on text – I’ll read it out. How much are you going to invest on securing your systems as
a lot of the work your employees are doing is sensitive and systems are prone to cyber attacks?
Salil Parekh
Thanks for that question. That is an extremely critical point. We have put in a tremendous amount
of work within the company to ensure that what we are doing at cyber security is world class. We
have a very dedicated team that focuses on the cyber security work across all our projects within
the company and how we interact with entities outside the company, outside so to speak our
firewall. We have an active board subcommittee on cyber security which also looks in this on a
quarterly basis. In that sense we are doing a lot that is required to be done to make sure that all our
work is going on as best as possible using the latest approaches on cyber security.
