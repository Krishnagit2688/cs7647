Thank you. The next question is from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Please
go ahead.

Let me echo the congratulations for this fiscal year. I just had one simple question across for
Nilanjan, can you remind us what the capital allocation strategy is. I remember you had put it
out during the analyst day in November 2020 but where is share repurchase in the prioritization.
Thank you.
Nilanjan Roy
What we had announced in FY20 basically, was that we have taken capital allocation to 85%,
prior to this it was 70% and we said that we will take that over the period of 5 years through a
combination of progressive growth-oriented dividend policy plus either share buyback or one
off special dividends. And in the first two years, as we have announced, we have actually paid
back 82% through higher increased normal dividends and also through share buyback which
we announced last year. We have already paid back 82% and we remain quite committed to
overall 85% over 5 years.
James Friedman
Got it. Thank you so much.
