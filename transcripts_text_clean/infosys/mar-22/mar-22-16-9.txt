Thank you. Salil, Nilanjan, I am going to read out some questions we have got from some of
our media friends who have not been able to join us physically, we about have five or six
journalists who sent questions. The first in the order is from ET Now and the question is the
reported numbers on topline and margins are below street expectations, was there a delay in
execution and on large deal TCV wins, should we continue expecting a range of $2 bn to $2.5
bn going forward or is there a plateauing of deal wins?

Let me start with that. I think on the full year, as we had shared earlier and Nilanjan mentioned
we have tremendous growth at 19.7% and the margin at 23%, so very strong execution all
around. For Q4 as Nilanjan shared and I shared, we had one-off instance which is related to
contractual situation. We see strong volume in Q4, we see very strong net addition to the
employee base at 22,000 and we have a very strong guidance of 13% to 15% growth, so all of
13the factors give us a view that we see good traction in the market with our clients and we
continue with our execution.
