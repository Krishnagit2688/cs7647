Thank you. The next question is from CNBC Awaaz. They want to know if you are seeing
signs of inflationary pressures on client budgets and if you could throw some light on the
texture of the deals for this quarter, which sector are they from?

So, on the inflationary pressure I think what we see with clients and what we see in the
environment all around, we see most industries are facing inflation in their own businesses and
they appreciate and understand, that we also have wage increases and other aspects to our
business that have been put in place, so yes there are discussions we are having more today
with our clients, which relate to discussions on pricing. We will see as and when they convert
actually into concrete steps, but certainly there are discussions on that basis. In terms of the
deals, we had a good spread across all of our sectors, we had 25 large deals in Q4, spread pretty
well across most of our business segments.
