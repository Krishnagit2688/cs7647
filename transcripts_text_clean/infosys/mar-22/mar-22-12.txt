Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please
go ahead.

Nilanjan, I believe that you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are anticipating that
the subcontractor costs are plateauing. I was just wondering why you are concluding that, is
that Visa related or is there something else we should be aware of.
Nilanjan Roy
So, our subcon costs are pretty much plateaued at around 11.1% in this quarter as a
percentage of revenue, but from an exit headcount perspective it has actually come down.
And the reason for this whole ramp up of this subcons is our recruitment engine was a bit
behind. We were hiring 11,000, 12,000 people each quarter and the balance demand was
being fulfilled by subcons. With us now getting into this mode of hiring freshers, we hired
22,000 people this quarter which is close to about 7% of the exit headcount. And as we look
24ahead we will continue to push on the pedal in terms of recruitment and replace many of the
subcons either through a replacement system or what we call a program of ‘subcon to hires’
in which we offer them a full time employment within the company. So, we have been doing
that. We have been at the lowest of the industry in 2019-2020 in terms of subcon. So, we
know where we have to get at. It may take us some time, a few quarters, but we know that's
the margin lever we can press on.
Jamie Friedman
Thank you and then I believe Nilanjan you also had quantified the client contract provision,
could you repeat the percentage impact if you stated it.
Nilanjan Roy
So it is less than a percentage and we think over a period of time this should come back.
Jamie Friedman
Got it, thank you I will get back in the queue.
