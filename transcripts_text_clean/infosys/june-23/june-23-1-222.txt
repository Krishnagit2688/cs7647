Yeah, good evening, everyone. I'm Abhirup Nandy, shareholder from Kolkata. Namaskar.
Respected Board members and key managerial personnel, I have connected from the City of Joy,
Kolkata. I'm very grateful regarding the financial performance. It is very strong whether it is growth or
cashflow. All have been very strong. Very happy with the financial performance. I just want to know
what our company is doing regarding the adoption and integration with the upcoming process of e-
rupee and how it is adopting with the digital form of currency that RBI has launched. And what is our
plan regarding our expansion of Cloud business, whether there is any plan for expansion? Rest, I'm
