Thank you, Mr. Kaushik. Now, may I request Mr. Santosh? Santosh, can you kindly go ahead and ask
your question?
Santosh Kumar Saraf
Maananiya aadyakshji, upasthith netayein and sadasgan, adhikarigan, aur mere shareholder bhaiyon
behenon, jo aaj video conference ke through present hai, main Santosh Kumar Saraf se, aap sabhi ka
namaskar karta hoon. Aur visheshkar hamare Manikantha ji ko bhi namaskar karta hoon, jinke ache
[unclear audio] aur unke team bhi bahut ache hai, unko bhi dhanyavaad deta hoon.
[Respected leaders, Board members, and fellow shareholders, who are all present on video conference
today, namaskar from me, Santosh Kumar Saraf. Namaskar also especially to Manikantha and team
and thanks to them for enabling this.]
Sabse pehle dhanyavaad deta hoon, Sir, is saal aapne jo [unclear audio] jo dividend diya hai, who high
dividend hai, iske liye dhanyavaad deta hoon. Doosra, Sir, main aapko iske liye bhi dhanyavaad deta
hoon ke aapke yahan 39.4% women employees hai, out of 3,40,000. Aur iske saath dukh is baat ka
hain ki women employees toh 40% hai, female directors sirf 12% hai. Toh main chahunga future mein
ek director aur laake isko kam se kam aage badhane ka koshish karenge. Jaise aapne kahaan women
empowerment ke liye aap kaam kar rahen hai, toh directors ke andar women empowerment nahin dikh
raha hai. Iska dhyan rakhenge, Sir.
- 15 -[First of all, thank you, Sir, you gave high dividend this year, thank you for this. Secondly, I would also
like to thank you because Infosys has 39.4% women employees out of a total of more than 3,40,000
employees. But, it is also sad that even when women employees make up 40%, female directors on the
Board is only 12%. So, I hope that in the future, you will hire a woman director to increase this. You
said you were working for women empowerment, but this women empowerment is not seen among
directors. Hope you will keep this in mind, Sir.]
Sir, last year, aapke active clients 1,872 hai, Sir, Toh isme abhi new client kitne hai? [unclear audio]
Agar aapke pass report hai, toh batane ki cheshta kariyega Sir.
[Sir, last year, you had 1,872 active clients. How many of these were new clients. If you have the
reports, please share with us.]
Sir, how many employees work from home? Percentage kya hai, unke numbers kya hain jo abhi work
from home kar rahe hai, Sir? Aur Sir, iske saat mein yeh hai, Sir, ke aapke yahaan jo buyback jo aapne
kiya, uska value, how many billion? Aapne highest price mein, 1539 mein buyback kiya Sir lekin
humein mila nahin, milta toh aaj humein kaafi help hogi. Toh future mein, hum chahunga Sir aap
buyback jab bhi karen, toh is route se karen, tender ki route se, jaise Wipro wale kar rahen hai. Usse
aap actual benefit jo shareholder ko dena chahenge, who unko milega. Otherwise kya hain ki
immediate jo sell karte hai, unko mil jaata hai. Hum jo bache long-term investors, jo aapka shares
bechna nahin chahte hain bazaar mein, who loser hote hai. Sir, iske baare mein zaroor vichar kariyega.
[unclear audio] Zaroor vichar kariyega, jo aapke loyal shareholder hai, woh toh bazaar mein maal
bechte nahin hai. Actually, unko tender ki through agar milta hai, toh benefit hota hai, otherwise benefit
nahin hota.
[Sir, how many employees are working from home. What is the percentage of those who are currently
working from home? Also, Sir, what is the value of the buyback you have done? Your buyback was
done at the highest price of 1,539 but we didn’t get it. IF we had got it, it would have been good. In
future, I hope you will do the buyback through the tender route, like Wipro does. By doing this, the
actual benefit that you want to give shareholders will reach them. Else, whoever sells immediately will
gain. For us, your long-term investors, who don’t want to sell in the open market, we become losers.
Sir, please think about this because your loyal shareholders, they won’t sell in the open market. If they
get it through the tender route, they will benefit. Otherwise, they don’t get any benefit.]
Main zyaada say nahin loonga. Sir, main yeh chahunga ki is saal kitne new employees aapne add kiye
hai, unke numbers kya hain aur Sir, unke female percentage kya hai. Zyaada samay nahin lete hai, ek
baar phir hamare jitne bhi director hai, jitne bhi adhikari hain aur jitne bhi shareholders jo video
conference pe hai, unko aur unke parivaar ko shubhkaamnayein deta hoon. Aur Bhagwan se prarthana
karta hoon, jo 2023 ka financial year hai, who sabhi ke liye healthy, wealthy, prosperous ho. Ek baar
aur Secretary and unke team ko dhanyavaad deta hoon, unke kadhi mehnat ki kaaran, dry run ki
kaaran hum meeting attend kar sakte hai. Namaskar.
- 16 -[I won’t take too much time. I would also like to know how many new employees were added this year,
and what was the percentage of female employees among them? I once again wish the people on the
call and their families all the best and wish the financial year 2023 will make them healthy, wealthy and
prosperous. Thank you once again to the secretarial team, whose hard work, and dry runs, helped us
participate in this meeting. Thank you.]
