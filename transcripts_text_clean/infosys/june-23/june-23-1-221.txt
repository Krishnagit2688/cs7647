Dilip
Namaskar Sir. Nandan Nilekani Sir. Salil Sir aur aapke secretary staff ko bahut bahut dhanyavaad
jinhone itna efforts karke aur iss meeting ko arrange kiya. Theen theen chaar chaar baar call karke
humse trial liya. Itne badiya arrange kiya yeh VC. Fellow shareholders ne sab cheez bol diya. jyada
bolne ke liye nahi hain. Main Jaipur, Pink city se bol raha hu. Aur, ek hi request thi aapse. Sir, ye jo
open market se aapne jo shareholder buyback ki, uski jaga ye shareholders se kyun nahi ki jaate?
Shareholder tho already loss mein hain, aur aap open market se â‚¹1,500 bhaav mein 1,850 ka share
khareed rahe hain. Toh, yeh Sir, shareholders ke saath mein yeh galat hain dekhajaye toh.
Baaki toh sir, jo decision aap logon ne liya woh soch ke liya hoga. Lekin thoda sa minority shareholders
ka bhi dhyan rakhna chahiye. Baaki sab ko bahut bahut dhanyavaad iss opportunity ke liye. Thank you,
sir.
[Thank you to Nandan Nilekani Sir, Salil Sir, and the entire Company Secretary team for all the efforts
you made to organize this meeting. The team called us several times for trial runs and made wonderful
- 30 -arrangements. My fellow shareholders have already discussed everything. I do not have much to add. I
am calling from Jaipur, the pink city.
I have a request, Sir. Why do not you go to the shareholders instead of going to the open market? The
shareholders have already made losses, and you buy back a share worth 1,850 for 1,500 . That is
completely wrong. That being said, I understand that any decision you made was well thought out. But
please also think about the minority shareholders. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. Thank you,
Sir.]
