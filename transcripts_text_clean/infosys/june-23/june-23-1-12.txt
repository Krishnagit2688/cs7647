Thank you, Mr. Hiranand. May I now request Mr. Alex? Mr. Alex, kindly go ahead and ask your
question.
Alex Punnen
Good afternoon, everyone. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for this opportunity. So I am Alex Punnen
joining from Bangalore. I’m a minority shareholder, actually. So I’m also a software developer for
around 20 years. So my question is related, something related to generative AI. I had to ask this
actually, I couldn’t sleep. So basically, I’ve been using this and I know the power of this actually. So it
increases productivity by around 30 to around 90%, depending on how it is used.So, the thing is that,
which Chairman Nandan Nilekani Sir and Salil Parekh Sir have told about Infosys Topaz™ and
- 20 -externally how clients are using it and are needing that. But, my question is internal looking. So if you
don’t adapt to this, this is going to be a threat, actually to our Company, actually. So maybe this is
already getting reflected in the market. I’m not really sure. But what is the plan, short-term and long-
term of Infosys in leveraging this technology for increasing productivity and quality? And, there are a lot
of implications to this. So what is our Company doing related with this? So it’s a hard question, but I
had to ask this because, yeah, this is on top of my mind, actually. But thanks once again, for this
opportunity.
