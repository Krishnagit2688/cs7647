Thank you, Mr. Manoj.
May now I request Mr. Ashish to kindly go ahead and ask the question?
Ashish
Respected Chairman and Board of Directors, firstly, I thank the Company Secretary to connect this
AGM today.
I hear the news about the employees working at home three days and three days in office. [Unclear
audio] Why are we working at home?
Also, you have gone for buyback. You are going to the open market. Why are you not going through
tender offer route? Small shareholders can participate. I cannot understand that point, Sir. Please clear
it. Also, I have given my vote. I do not want to take your time. If you can reply to my queries by name, I
am thankful to you. Thank you so much.
