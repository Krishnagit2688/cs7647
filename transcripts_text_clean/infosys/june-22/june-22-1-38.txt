Thank you. The next question is from Shivani Shinde from Business Standard and Shivani
has sent her questions on text. Salil, Nilanjan I am going to read it out. For Salil, there are a
couple of questions. With guidance of 14% to 16%, can you break the growth that you have
seen in terms of deal nature and pricing scenario, attrition continues to go up, will the hiring
19target be the same i.e., 50,000? The second is it looks like you and your peers have missed on
margin performance which kind of means that the supply issue is still out of control. How is
Infosys seeing the attrition going ahead? For Nilanjan, what is the headroom for margin
improvement and the impact of cross currency this quarter?

Guidance 14% to 16% breaking down the growth that you see in terms of the deal nature and
pricing scenario?
Salil Parekh
The guidance that we see today we have had very strong growth in Q1 at 5.5%, we see good
volume growth, and the way we see Q2 and the outlook on the quarters is a good pipeline for
our large deals plus we see good volume today in what we are seeing in the terms of activity
in Q2. So based on that we created the view in terms of the increase in our guidance. In terms
of pricing we see today stability in the pricing, so there was no unusual positive or negative
that we have seen in Q1 numbers vis-Ã -vis pricing.

I think I like somebody else or colleague of yours asked that in terms of 50,000 so last year
we have demonstrated a capacity to hire has been closer to 85,000 so we have the capacity to
hire but as I mentioned we do the entire talent model with a combination of freshers, looking
at attrition, looking at laterals and subcons and on the basis of that we still have the 50,000
mark but we can always increase that because we have the off-campus hiring program which
we can turn on.
