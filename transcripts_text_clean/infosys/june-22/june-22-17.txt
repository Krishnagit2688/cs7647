Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question. I now hand the conference over
to the management for closing comments.

Thank you everyone. Thanks again for joining for this call. I just want to summarize with a
few points; first we have had industry leading growth in Q1, 5.5% quarterly, 21.4% year-on-
year. We clearly see a tremendous market share gain driven primarily by the strength of our
digital and cloud - cobalt capability set that is resonating with our clients. We highlighted
there are pockets of weakness and we are aware of the environment around us. We see in our
pipeline both growth opportunities in digital cloud and cost opportunities in automation. With
all of that, we increase the growth guidance for the full year.
We are now seeing attrition coming down on a quarterly basis. We see many of the initiatives
we put in place starting to create some impact. We have levers for the margin, several that
Nilanjan shared, large programs will transition to steady state, COLA because of increases in
compensation costs to pricing, pyramid adjustments as we have college hires joining the
production environment, subcontractor usage and then several others on the cost side. Given
all of that we feel we are already well positioned to work with clients on their growth and
cost opportunities and have a margin profile that is something that sustains the high margin
approach of the company. We are looking forward to this year with strength and optimism.
Once again thank you all for joining us and catch up in the next quarter. Thank you.
