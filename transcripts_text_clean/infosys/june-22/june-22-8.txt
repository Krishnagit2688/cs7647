Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen and Company.
Please go ahead.
Bryan Bergin
Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just dig on the commentary around pockets of
weakness. So I heard you mentioned mortgages, mentioned subcomponent of retail. Can you
just give us a sense and quantify what mix of your business is actually seeing some slowing
decision making is it 5%, is it 10%, is it less and even does this help frame or quantify areas
that are seeing pockets of weakness?
Salil Parekh
Thanks for your question. This is Salil. We do not quantify typically what part of Financial
Services is mortgages or the other areas which are impacted. We are now seeing pockets, this
is not across our whole business. And the way I would look at it is with all of that given our
pipeline we have increased our revenue guidance. So the majority of our business is still
17seeing good demand. It is really pockets without quantifying, that is how I would give a
context to it.
Bryan Bergin
Okay and then just a follow-up on margin. You gave sequential changes can you give us what
the year-on-year changes in operating margin with the different categories?

So largely we know it was the comp related hike that is near only about 370 basis points that
was the biggest one and there were some rupee benefits offset by both cross currency as well
and then we got some benefits of cost optimization, we got some hits on lower utilization. So
these are the broad things but the biggest one was the comp which was about 370 basis
points.
Bryan Bergin
Alright thank you.
