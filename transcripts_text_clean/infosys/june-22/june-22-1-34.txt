Good evening gentlemen. Much has been talked about numbers. I would like to get an update
on the kind of traction and the deals that Infosys Metaverse Foundry is getting. Also in what
kind of sectors are you seeing the reception? Also do you think this offering would give you
increased gross margin in comparison with your other traditional offerings? Thank you.

Thanks for your question, Haripriya. I think the Metaverse Foundry is an excellent example
of where we have the leading capability in the market. We are one of the first if not the first
company to launch this. We have real examples of where this can create a positive impact
with clients. We already are doing some work on a very few select client situations so this is
starting to be a truly leading capability for us in the market. Having said that, it is something
that we put in a view that we talked about when we launched our strategy in things that will
develop over time. It is not something that is going to give us the benefit right here in this
quarter in terms of large scale but we see tremendous interest and really good traction in what
we are putting together in the Metaverse Foundry.
