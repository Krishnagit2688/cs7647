Hi good evening. My question is on supply-side challenges. Infosys gave double-digit salary
hikes to employees on an average last year so given that attrition right now is at elevated
levels itself and we are not sure when it might move back to normal levels far away from that
so do we expect similar salary hikes this year also or could it be even higher than last year?

We have done a lot during last year in June, and we have actually accelerated in nine months
we have had the April cycle, and at the same time we are seeing the moderation of the
attrition. We have also rolled out a more predictable talent program for our employees and
the same time we are getting freshers. So all this should help us going ahead in the future.
