go ahead.

Good evening just one question to Salil Sir, could you throw some light on the annual budgets
because compared to last year, in the middle of last year we had the pandemic, so do you see
some of those spends of your clients flowing into this year and also could you actually tell us
are these spends more in the areas of cost optimization kind of deals, which might taper down
once the pandemic normalizes?
Salil Parekh
Thanks for the question. The way we are seeing today, first there were some constraints, as you
rightly point out last year in the budget but that very quickly gave way to what you describe as
the efficiency cost discussions, but there was also a discussion on what can we do to change
our business in terms of becoming much more online, much more digital, much more
connected, so that they could expand their own connects in the market. Today, what we are
seeing is that both of those continue, there is a huge focus and through our work on automation
and artificial intelligence we are at the forefront of helping our clients, be much more efficient
with respect to the tech spend. There is also the focus on building out new capabilities on their
side, which allow them to be more fluid in the digital online environment. Some of that is a
cost, some of that is a spend for them but a lot of that is also becoming an investment for them.
So, it is a different way that they are looking at technology and that is partially why we see
some of the boost because once large companies look at technology also as an investment it is
a completely different pool from which they are looking to do their investment and then the
returns that they are looking on it in terms of market growth or business repositioning or
efficiency, which is the outcome that they are getting. So those are the changes that we are
seeing in the way the budgets are evolving.
