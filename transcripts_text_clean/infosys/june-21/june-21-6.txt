Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from CLSA. Please go ahead.

Thanks for the opportunity. Salil, my first question is also on this net new deal TCV, I think in
the press meet, you had mentioned that the focus of clients is now shifting away from cost
14optimization. So, does it mean that clients are now taking longer to decide on the deal as well
as in terms of the deal construct? Is that what is leading to maybe a softer net new deal TCV
for us?

The quarter-on-quarter view of that percentage is always a little bit up and down. What we
have seen in the pipeline is significant amount of activity where clients are looking at moving
on the digital transformation program as also working on areas which relate to cost efficiency,
as also, we are seeing opportunities, which we have discussed in the past, of vendor
consolidation. But we do not think that the timeline has changed in terms of deal movement,
nor do we see some different sort of criteria in terms of the types of deals or the pricing. What
is clear is with the broad economic growth in our end markets which is coming back rapidly,
is allowing for many industries to go through the transformation. Companies within industries
accelerating - companies which had lower digital presence are going faster to catch up and lead
from, companies which already have digital presence are making sure that they maintain their
advantage. So, all those things bode well for the technology spend where we are positioned
quite nicely.
