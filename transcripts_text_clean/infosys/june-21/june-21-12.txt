Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global. Please go
ahead.

Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations for a strong execution. The first question is
margin related. Can you quantify what will be the impact of wage hike and Daimler deal in
Q2? The second question is also related to margin in the medium term, now 22% to 24% margin
trajectory, which we are confident to defend for this year. But if one wants to understand from
a long-term perspective, do we think considering that digital is now more than half the revenue
and growing very strongly plus overall a strong demand environment, we can again achieve
our historical 25% kind of EBIT trajectory?

On the margin question, Daimler large deal is all factored in. We do not break out the impact
of Daimler, we look at cost optimization across projects, we look at the various levers we talked
about. That in a way all built in to our 22% to 24% guidance.

I think your question was because it is becoming larger, will that give us an opportunity to have
a different higher margin. We certainly see that the digital business is at a higher margin than
24our company average today. However, the guidance that we are giving for this financial year,
for operating margin, which is 22% to 24%, there are many levers as Nilanjan shared. Of
course, there are several areas which increased the cost as well. All of those will balance out
and at the end of this year, we will provide the view for the following year. But we do not have
any particular view on that different number at this stage.
