Thank you, Salil. Joining Salil is Mr. Nilanjan Roy, Chief Financial Officer, Infosys. With that
we will open up for questions. The first question is from Ritu Singh from CNBC TV18.
Ritu Singh
Hi Salil. A quick question on your guidance that you have given from 15% - 16% revenue, you
have tightened it further to about 14% - 16%. The upper end remains the same, but if you could
give a sense on what made you tighten the guidance? And also, your share buyback, you have
the option to go all the way up to 18,000 as we understand then why capped at about Rs.9,000
crore odd that you have done?

On the guidance, we have had an incredibly large deals performance in this quarter at $2.7 bn.
We have had strong momentum at 18.8% growth in the quarter. We continue to see good
traction. We also see that there is some caution. Last time we had mentioned that we saw some
caution in mortgages in financial services. We talked about retail. We now see some caution in
hi-tech and in telecom. Keeping all of those factors -- the positive factors and the global macro
factors, we have decided to make our guidance narrower at the higher end of the band that we
had - so it was 14% - 16% and now it is 15% - 16%. On the share buyback, let me request
Nilanjan to address that.
Nilanjan Roy
On the share buyback, of course, the board considers a lot of factors, but coming to your
specific point on the maximum. Since this is an open market offer, it is limited to 15% of the
share capital and reserves which is about Rs.9,400 odd crore -- give or take. So, the board has
decided on a figure of Rs.9300 crore.
