Thankyou. The next question is from Financial Express. What is the revenue model for Infosys
from 5G? Are you in talks with clients to leverage the opportunity? There is also another
question on moonlighting which we have already answered.

On 5G, it is really a step change in the world as it is in India. At Infosys, we have developed
huge sets of capabilities for 5G, with client solutions first for the telco industry and also for use
cases which are for other industries leveraging 5G. For example, retail, financial services,
logistics, warehousing, there is a host of these use cases being developed. We see a huge
amount of traction in this business as we look forward and so it is one of the growth drivers
that we will continue to see in the future.
