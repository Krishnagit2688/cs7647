15On the hiring of the freshers so there is a large number of people that you have hired and? I
just wanted to ask what kind of impact when these freshers get on to newer projects will it have
on your cost optimization and margins?

Regarding the hiring of college graduates, I think last year we did something in the range of
80,000 college graduates who joined us. One of the things that we are extremely good at and
known for is our training program and especially now that everyone is back in person at Mysuru
training centre and in addition to what we have now which is online. We have also set up
training for some of the modules within our different DCs, i.e., our delivery centers. We find
that these individuals coming out of the Infosys training are extremely ready to start to be
productive and they help us tremendously. Last year we had 20% growth, with Q1 having 21%.
This quarter has 18% growth, so that needs tremendous input that we see from new employees
joining us.
