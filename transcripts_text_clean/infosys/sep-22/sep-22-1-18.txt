The last question for this evening is from Mint. On the India market, given that there has been
a steady growth of enterprise spends for digital transformation in India, how does Infosys
expect the domestic market to contribute in the coming quarters?
Salil Parekh
We are extremely bullish on where the Indian digital transformation agenda is. We have done
projects which are really mission-critical. We can see, for example, on the GST program, there
is a tremendous realization and increase in the collection that the government is seeing through
the digital implementation of a completely new platform. We have seen similar things this year
with the IT platform. So, we are well positioned to do scaled digital transformation programs
and we look forward to working with government organizations and private companies in that
area as appropriate.
