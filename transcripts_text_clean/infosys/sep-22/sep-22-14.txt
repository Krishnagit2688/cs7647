ahead.

Thank you for the opportunity. Just had one clarification question related to the margin
performance or the margin improvement this quarter when one looks at our cost schedule,
you said subcontracting expenses are down by about 120 BPS while in your opening remarks
you suggested that subcontracting expenses are down 40 BPS so just to understand if some of
the large deals cost optimization being captured in the cost of taking subcontractors.

25Yes so I think that is the cost as a percentage of revenue, but the impact on margin is what is
the premium you are paying to subcontractors vs. own employee so it is not a mathematical
impact of subcontractor cost coming down from 11 to 10 - by that token if we say if we can
bring down subcontractors to zero our margins can go up by 10%. So this is just the premium
you are paying to the subcontractors which is impacting your margins. That is the 40 BPS.

One last question was with regards to the hiring that we have seen through the year we have
already hit the full year hiring target in terms of the fresher intake how are we thinking about
the fresher intake in the second half of the year given the fact that there have been some
media reports of companies in the sector delay on fresher onboarding.
Nilanjan Roy
Yes, so like I said we had 40000 in H1 and we will be above 50000. We will get back later on
the numbers but we will go above the 50000.
Manik Taneja
Sure thanks and all the best for future.
