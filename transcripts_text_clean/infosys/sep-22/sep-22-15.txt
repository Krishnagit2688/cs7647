Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ravi Menon from Macquarie. Please go
ahead.
Ravi Menon
Thank you and congratulations for excellent performance this quarter especially considering
that utilization has dropped. Can you talk a bit about how you see headroom for utilization
and margin improvement as attrition has started to decline?
Nilanjan Roy
26Yes, sure so I think at 83.6% we are much lower than what historically we have been. The
fresher which we have got in, we want to make sure that they are learning both at our training
facility in Mysore plus on the bench. So we are very cognizant of not putting them into
projects on day one and therefore we are ready to take a hit on the margins and utilization on
account of this. We know this is long-term investment for us. We strongly believe the
industry can only grow through fresher intake year-on-year and that is an investment we are
ready to make and over a period of time. As the demand picks up and we are able to train
them we can rotate them into project - so we are quite comfortable, and of course, we want to
get this figure slowly inching back to the more comfortable 85% levels.
Ravi Menon
While you talked about concerns started to emerge in industry verticals like retail, high-tech,
telecom and the mortgage subverticals, have we actually started seeing project cancellations
or we are just seeing slower decision making for new programs.
Salil Parekh
So today where there are discretionary work we see slowness in that area. We will keep
watch on anything else that starts to develop in those specific industry verticals.
Ravi Menon
So do we mean that there have been no cancellations yet?
Salil Parekh
So we do not see cancellations of programs, we see slowness in the discretionary part of the
programs.
Ravi Menon
Okay, thank you so much best of luck.
