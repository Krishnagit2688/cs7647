Thank you. Our next question is from the line Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Please go ahead.

14Hi, this is Zack Ajzenman on behalf of Bryan. First question that we have is on the revenue
per fulltime employee, looks like it is trended lower for multiple quarters now can you give
us a sense of the dynamics here, what the expectation is going forward?
Nilanjan Roy
This is directly reflecting our utilization as well. So, like I mentioned in fact pricing has been
actually stable to positive this quarter, but revenue per employee is across entire headcount of
the company and we have put so many freshers in both in our training programs in Mysore
and on the bench. So, this is just a mathematical number around revenue per employee, it is
not indicating anything about pricing really. There is also cross-currency impact as well, as
you can imagine because only 68% odd of our revenues are in dollars, 32% are on currency
outside dollars and those have depreciated, so just as a pure metric it will also automatically
come down.
Zack Ajzenman
Understood make sense and followup is more of a broader one on the macro, so more
industries are seeing caution now we have heard Hi-Tech and Telecom this quarter in
addition to what we heard in the prior quarter, are there any other specific areas that are
expecting to get worse going forward based on line of sight here?
Salil Parekh
What we are seeing today is in the areas that you just mentioned and that reflects in some of
the discretionary spend which is slowing. We also see that the large deals pipeline is at a very
strong level, so we see somehow some balance in the cost programs also becoming a part of
the large deals pipeline, but in terms of the macro we will see those areas as of today that we
are watchful and making sure we have early signs if any other areas show this sort of a point
in the future.

Thank you.
