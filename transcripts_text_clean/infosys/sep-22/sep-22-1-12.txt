Thank you. The next few questions are on text. We have a question from Shivani Shinde from
Business Standard - Attrition is still in the 20% range. By when do you see this coming down
to sub-20%?

On attrition, my sense is that it has come down three quarters in a row for us. Each quarter is a
sizeable, large step. All of the initiatives that have been put in place by the company and by the
HR leadership are starting to yield some benefits. Over time my sense is that we will continue
to see more benefits with attrition.
