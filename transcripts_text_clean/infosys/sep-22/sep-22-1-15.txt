Thank you. The next question is from CNBC Awaaz. Are you sensing any hesitation from
clients on expanding budgets? What is the sentiment of clients in Europe? You mentioned some
pressure in the BFSI sector, is it likely to worsen?

17On the client environment, the information that we read comes down to us in different formats.
One is that we have two big drivers or engines on digital which is growing in Q2 for us and
core services which is also growing. Both are supported by very strong capabilities whether it
is Cobalt or automation. We also see that there are specific areas in the macro environments
where we are more cautious - mortgages in financial services, retail, and some parts of hi-tech
or telecom. But at the same time, our large deals pipeline is doing quite well, and we see good
traction in this quarter in large deals which was at $2.7 bn. So all of those are different aspects
of what we see in the environment.
