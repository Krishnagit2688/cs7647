Thank you. The next question is from Zee Business from Kushal Gupta. Kushal’s question for
Salil – Europe’s growth has been great with 28.5% constant currency growth. Is there actually
no issue with client IT budgets for the next year amidst the fears of recession? For Nilanjan,
operationally the performance has been great, what were the key factors behind this and the
outlook ahead?

We have had very good traction in Europe for the last several quarters and that has shown again
in this quarter’s growth number. We continue to see that the pipeline of large deals is strong,
but we are also cautious and watching the macro development. Today our pipeline looks good
and our guidance for the full year, therefore, is at 15% - 16%.

On the operations, as we have mentioned, we have a good margin story but I think even beyond
that our ability to absorb freshers and making sure that they are trained, they are picking up
new skills, putting them into projects, and then over a period of time start rotating them.
Because this talent pipeline for us we knew, in the long run, is the only way this industry would
grow other than rotational churn. Therefore, in fact, in the first half we have already done, I
7think close to 40,000 freshers across the company in all streams. So, we are quite hopeful in
terms of absorbing the freshers, putting them through their paces, and then start putting them
into large deals and other deals as well and that has been a big learning for us during this entire
process.
