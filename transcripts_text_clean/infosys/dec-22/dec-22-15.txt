Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question. I now hand the conference back to the
management for closing comments.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Fantastic to have our Q3 close out, 13.7% growth,
21.5% operating margin, $3.3 bn in large deals, very happy with that outcome.
We can see a guidance increase on our growth for that. And we can see both sides of
our business on transformation, digital work and core services, cost automation
working well.And so we feel good with the current environment and how we can play and support
our clients on both sides.
Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to catching up during the quarter.
Thank you.
