Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sameer Dosani from ICICI Prudential
Asset Management. Please go ahead.

Thanks a lot. Just one question around Europe again. If I look at your commentary
around regions in North America versus Europe, Europe looks more cautious overall.
But if I look at performance for the last few quarters, I think Europe has been
performing better than North America as a whole.
So, do you think this impact of the cautiousness is yet to reflect in the numbers and you
see more growth trajectory will be a little more affected, going forward, in your
thoughts around that?

I think, in Europe, there is two different things. We have had a very strong Europe
program, both on transformation and cost over the last 18, 24 months. So, some of that
comes through in the benefits we see, even in this quarter.
The commentary or the view is more to share what we are seeing just in the economic
activity. And again, we see the coloring more by industry, which is a little bit global as,
opposed to just specifically across the board in a geography.

So the outlook -- I mean, do you think the outlook that you're giving will reflect in the
numbers in medium term in the next two quarters because till now, it has been an
outperformer versus the overall portfolio? Thanks.
Salil Parekh
So there, we have given a view on outlook only up until March this year, so we will
come up with a guidance for the next financial year at the end of this quarter.Sameer Dosani
Okay and that is it from my side. Thanks.
