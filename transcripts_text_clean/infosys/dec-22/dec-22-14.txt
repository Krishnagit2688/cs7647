Our next question is from the line of Girish Pai from Nirmal Bang Securities.
Girish Pai
Yes. Thank you for the opportunity. I just wanted to understand with cost optimization
deals more in the pipeline and in the TCV, has the average deal tenure gone up in the
last couple of quarters?
Salil Parekh
So, thanks for the question. We donâ€™t typically comment on the deal tenure in terms of
public statements.
Girish Pai
Okay, you said that the third-party items, have given you a lot of traction in terms of
getting deals. Now the number has gone up from about less than 2% of revenue to
almost like -- I think this quarter is -- in this quarter, it comes to almost 6.5% of revenue.
Do you see this number going up in the coming quarters and years?Nilanjan Roy
Like I said, our offering is quite holistic. In some cases, many of the cloud-based deals
come with services, there could be licenses, there could be DaaS. So more and more
integrated deals.
And then you go to IT as a Service, which is really sort of very holistic, we could see
this. But I mean, it may vary from quarter to quarter, you could have some quarters
which are up. But there's nothing to say that in the long run where this is going. It's a
bit early to say that.
Girish Pai
Okay. And lastly, from a competitive landscape perspective in the vendor consolidation
deals, who are the ones losing out? Are these the global MNCs or these are typically
Tier 2 vendors?
Salil Parekh
Again, on those, we don't specifically comment on where we are getting the benefit of
the consolidation. We are seeing some benefits coming through with large clients.
Girish Pai
Ok, thank you very much.
