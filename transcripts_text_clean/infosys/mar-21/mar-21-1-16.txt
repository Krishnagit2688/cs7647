Thank you. The next question is from ET Prime, Jochelle Mendonca who joins us over audio.

We have seen net new deals in the large deals, 60% this year compared to 30% last year, have
you made changes in how you chase large deals that will account for this kind of massive jump in
the net new quantum and are you expanding the large deals team to address the increasing
demand we are seeing on the clientâ€™s side?

I think, we are continuously looking at better ways to connect with our clients. In that light, every
quarter, and every year we make refinements to how we approach the market, that is part of the
ongoing way that our business is evolving especially on large deals and many other areas of the
company. In terms of what we are seeing in expansions, there as well we feel there is a good
outlook in terms of what we see in the demand. So, there is an overall expansion that we are
looking on how we build our go to market capabilities, whether it is for large deals, overall CSG
and sales, new account openings or the account expansion approach, so overall we feel there are
more ways that we will have to connect with clients.
