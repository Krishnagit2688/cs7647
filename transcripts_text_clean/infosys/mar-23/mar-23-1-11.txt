Thank you. The next few questions are on text from friends from media who have sent it to us.
I just want to make a quick announcement that we are going to consider those questions in the
interest of time which haven't yet been addressed. Most of our questions have been addressed.
The first question on text is from Anisha Jain from ET Now. And Anisha's question, Salil, is
to you. Regarding the one-time revenue impact, you said in your opening comments, is there a
slowdown caused by a client-specific issue or a specific sector, or is it broad-based?

Yes, like we mentioned, I think the majority of the revenue slowdown is from volume. And
part of the one-timer, which is on revenue, is a combination of one-time client issues as well
as client cancellation, in a way which is a subset of the ramp-downs.
