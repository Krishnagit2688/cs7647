Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the
conference over to the management for closing comments. Over to you, sir.

Thanks everyone for joining us. As we shared through the call, first, for the full year
we had good growth, good margin, good cash collection. We saw during the quarter
some situations which were new situations during the quarter with the changing
environment. We have a strong guidance for next year of 4% to 7% of growth. We
have a good guidance on margin. We have put in place even more emphasis on our
cost and efficiency plan, which has many components at a detailed level, and we look
to see that benefit come through over a multi-year period and aspire to higher
margins.
And we have an extremely strong pipeline with large deals and some mega deals,
especially on cost efficiency and automation. With that, we feel the business remains
in a good position and we have the ability to work through different environments on
digital transformation and on cost efficiency consolidation as the course of the year
develops. So, we look forward to executing on that and connecting with you at the
end of this Q1. Thank you.
