Thank you. The next question is from CNBC Awaaz for Salil. Has the sentiment worsened
among clients? Is there fear of further uncertainty or just caution? Does the uncertainty and
delay in decision-making make it likely to play on the pricing of deals in the coming quarters?

So there, the way we saw -- during the quarter we saw some of our clients looking at ramp-
downs in their projects, and then there were some one-time impact on revenue. These were
spread across different industries. There were some in Telecom, some in Hitech, Retail and
parts of Financial Services. We see some stabilization in March, but the demand environment
is uncertain. So, we will watch it and with agility and adapt to it.
