Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen.
Bryan Bergin
Hi. Good evening. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the growth outlook first. At the
midpoint of your 4% to 7% range, can you give us a sense on how much of the backlog
is already in hand versus having to go out and convert upon the pipeline to achieve that
growth target? And does the amount that you have to sign in that pipeline to hit the
target differ relative to prior years at this time?
Salil Parekh
Hi, this is Salil. Thanks for that. We don't have a specific number there that we share
externally. What I can share is, we see through this past financial year, we have had a
good, large deals booking, $9.8 bn with 40% net new and we see a set of very strong
active relationships, some of them are expanding through the year through other work.
And then we saw in Q4 during the quarter, some ramp downs. So, keeping those factors
in mind, we have built the guidance of 4% to 7%. And we see that we have the ability
to deliver on that guidance.
Bryan Bergin
Okay. And my follow-up is kind of on margins here. So, you've cited internal efficiency
programs that you are going to progress upon, I think, pyramid, office consolidation
and other items. Is there a stated target of cost reduction that you are expecting to
achieve? So, a run rate of operating margin expansion? Just trying to get a sense of how
you think about the structural margins of the business, assuming the efficiency
initiatives youâ€™ve cited?Salil Parekh
So, there, we put together an internal plan with targets and, a road map for each of the
subcategories that we outlined and a few others. And we have a view to drive that
through the next period here in the coming quarters. We have not shared that target
externally, but our view is to make sure that we put in place, execute on that programs
in place and deliver to that in the medium term.
Bryan Bergin
Thank you.
