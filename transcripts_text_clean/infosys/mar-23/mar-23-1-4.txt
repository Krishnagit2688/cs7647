Thank you. The next question is from Jochelle Mendonca from ET Prime.

Hello, I want clarification on something you have said in the press release. You' have said that
you have expanded your internal program on efficiency and cost to build a higher path to
margins. I am asking this specifically because I am looking at headcount, and headcount fell in
this quarter, but it fell more on the software professionals while sales and support staff actually
went up marginally. So, could you give me some clarity on what this efficiency program is and

how it is feeding into how you look at the sales staff and what augments or detractions you
might make on that front?

That I think is a very critical program. We were running it. In fact, Nilanjan was driving that
with a very strong team. We have expanded the attention to that program during the last quarter.
We have several methods in which we can do better in that program, whether that relates to
automation, it relates to pyramid, it relates to onsite mix, relates to subcontractors, relates to
travel. And also relating to pricing and how we can drive that within our system, given the
inflation that all of us have seen.
What we are communicating with that is that program gets a very focused attention. And we
have within our internal way of looking at it, a path to bring us to the aspired margin that we
want, because we want to be at that margin as we go ahead. Having said that, we have low
utilization that Nilanjan mentioned. We are going to make sure that we look after our people
with that commitment. We are going to make sure that we continue with the training, and that
is an area we will continue our focus on. We are not going to take some short-term actions
against that and that will be a way to build it because over time, that is a team that will start to
work on projects as well.
