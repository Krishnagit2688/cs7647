Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from AMBIT Capital
Private Limited. Please go ahead.
Ashwin Mehta
Thanks for the opportunity. So Salil, what is the nature of this one-off client issue?
And when this reverse out like we saw last year in the same quarter, where we took aclient contract provision. Secondly, is it a single client or multiple client issue that we
are talking about? And in which segment have you seen this client issue? And I have a
follow-up.
Nilanjan Roy
Yes. So like I said earlier, this is a one-off client revenue issues and there are a
number of clients. It is a mixture of clients, and some of it is a provision against them.
Some may come back, some may not come back and some of it is also linked to
cancellations. Because the revenue impact also beyond the volume impact of
cancellations. Yes there is a mixture of clients there.
Ashwin Mehta
And the 10% decline that we have seen in US Telecom, is it related to this, these client
issues because that appears to be a pretty steep decline?
Nilanjan Roy
10% decline in?
Ashwin Mehta
In the US telecom business of yours?
Nilanjan Roy
No, I don't think anything specific is coming out of these issues really.
Ashwin Mehta
Okay. And the last one is, if I look at your guidance it implies a 2.9% sequential growth
over the next four quarters. The last we saw this ex of the COVID surge was in FY '16,
so what drives such a high growth comfort for us in an uncertain environment?
Salil Parekh
Can you repeat please?
Ashwin MehtaSo the CQGR requirement for your top end of guidance is around 2.9% sequential every
quarter. This is something that excluding of FY '22, we have seen last in FY '16. So in
an uncertain demand environment, what drives such a high-growth comfort?
Salil Parekh
So, what we have seen with our guidance is we have some good large deals that we
closed in the previous financial year. And we have a pipeline, several of them mega
deals which gives us the opportunity to have those come into our mix and give us a
flow through the year.
Ashwin Mehta
So would you say the sub $50 mn deal flow is where the traction is much stronger than
what appears in the greater than $50 mn deal flow that we announce typically?
Salil Parekh
We don't have a view that we share typically on the non-large deals, but our large deals
is one of the components that we use to build out the guidance.
Ashwin Mehta
Sure Salil, thanks a lot and all the best.
