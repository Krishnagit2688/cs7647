Hi Salil and team. First of all, a quick clarification, when you said, fastest growth in ten years, are
you referring to YoY fastest growth in revenues? That is number one. Number two is that since a
lot of these banks, etc., financial services institutions are actually setting up their own technology
centers here in India or their GICs, are you actually kind of losing share of work to the GICs?
Thank you.

Thanks for your question. I think on the first one, we are seeing both on a sequential basis and on
a YoY basis. This growth is the fastest we have had in over a decade, so we are extremely
delighted that, that is the way our clients are perceiving us.
On what some of the banks are doing as we shared in terms of setting up their centers, what we
see is there is a tremendous amount of demand and especially in the banking sector but in several
other sectors where also centers are set up, for example, retail, or Hi-Tech and there are projects
which are done by those centers. In several cases, we actually are collaborating with the centers
as they are scaling up to make sure that we support bank or retail company or others both in the
western geographies as well as in India. So, today, we do not see that that is something that is
taking away from the work that we are doing. There is a large amount of work that we still see that
is coming straight from many of our clients and many of the projects that we do when we have
centers, we collaborate with them as well.
