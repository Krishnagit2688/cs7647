Good afternoon. Mr Parekh you did mention about the fact that this is perhaps the fastest growth
in the last one decade. You have also increased the guidance as well, so just wanted to know
whether this kind of growth is maintainable, given the fact that especially Europe and US offices
have started reopening, pandemic has to a great extent retreated in several countries in Europe
and US, do you think that this growth is maintainable?

There, the way we see it is today, the overall demand outlook as we engage with clients is very
strong. To give you an example, I was in a discussion two weeks ago with a client where they are
asking us to expand the work we do with them in a material way across a variety of their programs,
some of them on Digital and others on other technologies. These are sorts of discussions, me, our
colleagues, who are interacting with clients are having. So we feel comfortable with the economy
coming back in many of the western markets that this will continue. Of course, what we have done
with the guidance is for this financial year and that is the outlook that we share with the overall
change or the digital transformation that many industries are going through is quite remarkable.
Many companies, which were not in the digital space, not in the online space are now shifting at a
rapid speed and those are areas where we can help and support them. Many companies that
were native digital companies are also growing very fast where we can help and support them. So,
from all of those perspectives today the demand looks very good.

Alright. Thank you Mr. Parekh.
