Thank you, Salil. The next question is from Jochelle Mendonca from ET Prime. The question is for
Salil and Pravin. Can you give us a breakup on the large deal wins? How much was renewals
versus net new deals? The second question is in terms of hiring from campuses, is Infosys looking
at compacting its training programs to deploy this talent faster?

In terms of large deals, we had as we said $2.6 bn TCV, 22 large deals cutting across segments, 9
in Financial Services, 4 each in CRL and EURS, 2 in manufacturing and one each in other
verticals. Geography wise we had 14 in Americas, five in Europe, two in Rest of the World and one
in India and 30% is net new out of this large deal win.
The second one from a campus perspective as we said earlier, we are planning to recruit a total
number of about 35,000 college graduates worldwide. Even in the past we have tried to look at
accelerating the training duration and faster deployment for a specific set of college graduates. For
instance, if someone has already been trained in computer science and if someone is a computer
science graduate or someone has advanced technology experience, in those cases we have a
much condensed training schedule so that they can be deployed on projects in a much quicker
way. But, for people graduating in some of the other disciplines, we continue to take about nearly
three-and-a-half to four months to complete the training duration. We believe that is important to
lay a very strong foundation and at the end of it, they become pretty much productive in the
projects.
