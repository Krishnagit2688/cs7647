Thank you, Shilpa. The last question for this evening has been sent by Maya Sharma from NDTV
and I am going to read out her question gentlemen. One of you can choose to respond to it. In
response to the ongoing Zomato IPO and all the new recent unicorns, broadly what does this
mean for the startup sector in India?

So, let me take that and others may have a view. I think it is incredible to see the success of all of
these companies, many of them which are based on technology and of course in the way that they
leverage it in the digital ecosystem. I think it is going to give a lot of boost to all technology
businesses within the country and of course give a boost to much more innovation that we see
coming over the years increasingly coming from India.
