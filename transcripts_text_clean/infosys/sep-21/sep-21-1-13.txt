Thank you, Salil. Thank you, Pravin. The next question is from Alnoor Peermohamed from The
Economic Times. Alnoor joins us on the audio. Alnoor, please go ahead.
Alnoor Peermohamed
Good evening everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My question is to Salil. I would like to
know what do you think will be the impact of the recently signed executive order by US President
Joe Biden on the IT Services and Outsourcing Industry?
Salil Parekh
Alnoor, which specific order you are referring to?
Alnoor Peermohamed
The one to boost competition in the US - 72 specific orders on various industries including banks
where they have talked about portability of data of consumers between banks. How could that sort
of affect the IT Services industry?
Salil Parekh
I think the focus there as you mentioned was on the competitiveness of the US businesses. From
our perspective, I do not know broadly about the sector, our own focus in that, is we are seeing
that as those companies become more competitive, we will certainly benefit. In terms of data and
protection, we are already very much supportive of the approach that various of our clients have
taken within the insurance companies and the banks where this is a greatest impact. We feel we
will be able to support them as they go through, some of the changes that may be required or that
may come from this. But the details of this still are being worked out as you know and once they
get worked out, we will get a sense of what the impact will be specifically for our clients and
therefore how that will impact the changes that we have to do the work.
