Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen,
I hope you and your families are healthy and safe.
The 3rd wave of COVID is posing challenges for the country at large. We are following all
government protocols and taking all precautionary steps in the best interest of employee’s health
and safety including that of our value chain partners.
Let me start with some highlights of our product offerings and our company initiatives.
We exported 205,450 vehicles in Calendar year 2021. It is the highest ever exports in any
calendar year by the company.
In the calendar year 2021, 8 of the 10 best-selling passenger vehicles were from Maruti Suzuki.
We are deeply grateful to our customers for choosing Maruti Suzuki as their most preferred
passenger vehicle brand.
One of the notable aspects in quarter 3 was the launch of the India’s most fuel-efficient petrol
car, “All-New Celerio”. We are witnessing a good initial response. The new Celerio has a fuel
efficiency of 26.68 km/liter and its CNG variant has a mileage of 35.60 km/kg.

MSIL Conference Call Transcript 25 January 2022Maruti Suzuki Baleno is the fastest selling premium hatchback car to cross a million-unit sales.
Maruti Suzuki Super Carry, the country’s most powerful mini-truck has recently achieved the
record milestone of 100,000 unit of cumulative sales in just 5 years of its launch.
Maruti Suzuki’s state-of-the-art online car financing solution has received a phenomenal
customer response. Maruti Suzuki Smart Finance platform has disbursed cumulative INR 65,000
million auto loans to over 1 lakh customers within 9 months of its launch.
Taking a step towards circular economy, Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Tsusho Group’s Vehicle
Scrapping and Recycling unit commenced operations. The facility offers hassle-free, end-to-end
solution for customers to scrap vehicles in a safe and environment friendly way with a capacity
to scrap and recycle over 24,000 vehicles annually.
Continuing on the path to promote the culture of safe and responsible driving in the country,
Institute of Driving and Traffic Research (IDTR) was inaugurated in Chhattisgarh. This is the
8th IDTR in the country managed under our CSR program.
Coming to the business environment that prevailed during the 3rd quarter, the Company
continued to experience shortage of electronic components, especially during the quarter marked
with festive period, when the demand for cars usually remains good.
An estimated 90,000 vehicles could not be produced during the 3rd quarter owing to the global
shortage of electronics components mostly corresponding to the domestic models. Though still
unpredictable, the electronics supply situation is improving gradually. The Company hopes to
increase production in Q4, though it would not reach full capacity.
The enquiry, bookings and retail sales in 3rd quarter has shown an improvement sequentially.
Enablers such as finance availability and interest rates continue to remain favourable.
On cost side, the commodity prices increased significantly over the course of last one year and
has been the most adverse factor impacting the net profit. The Company made maximum efforts
to absorb input cost increases offsetting them through cost reduction and passed on a minimal
impact to customers by way of car price increase.
Overall, during the 3rd Quarter, adverse commodity prices, lower volumes and lower non-
operating income compared to that of same period previous year have adversely impacted the
profit performance.
Coming to financial results:
