: The next question is from the line of Kumar Rakesh from BNP Paribas.
Kumar Rakesh: My first question is that historically we have noticed the seasonality in June quarter where the
volume declines from March level. Given that we have a very strong order book should we
expect, that usual seasonality should not be there in the June quarter assuming no incremental
impact on the semiconductor supply issue?
Rahul Bharti: This time the determining factor will be semiconductors so of course demand exists. At the
moment demand is good. We'll have to go by supply.
Kumar Rakesh: And second question was around exports. We have seen pretty strong ramp up there; at the same
time, we are running a very large order book in the domestic market. Any strategic reason for
prioritizing the export markets over the domestic market?
Rahul Bharti: No. It is not a question of our strategizing. It's a question of chip availability. So, the specs are
different, the sources of chips in the export models are different. If we had an option, we would
obviously have the domestic market first. Since we could not produce those domestic models
and the chip shortage did not affect the export model therefore, we use the export opportunity.
Kumar Rakesh: One final clarification on the order book part. You said that current order book is more than
320,000 units. That's more than 50,000 increase in less than a monthâ€™s time. Has that underlying
demand is significantly accelerated or our production is different than where it was earlier in this
year?
Rahul Bharti: It is the new Baleno also. We have the Ertiga and XL6 launch also.
