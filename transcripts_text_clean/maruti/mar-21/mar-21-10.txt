: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sonal Gupta from UBS. Please go ahead.
Sonal Gupta: I had a couple of questions. One was, could you share the retail volumes for the fourth quarter?
Shashank Srivastava: For Maruti Suzuki?
Sonal Gupta: Yes sir.
Shashank Srivastava: So, of course, these are like shared figures, so these are obviously approximate figures. So, this
year Q4, the retail for Maruti Suzuki was about 419,000.
Sonal Gupta: And sir, would you be able to share what was the share of top 10 cities and top 11 to 20 in the
full year sales?

PageShashank Srivastava: Yes. So, top 10 cities, it is I think 34% was the top 10 cities share. So, city wise, first to 10 if
you look at the total retails in the industry contribution of top 10 cities is 34.9%; for 10 to 20 it
is 12.2%; for 20 to 40 it is 14.6%; and all the rest is 38.3%.
Sonal Gupta: Right, that's very helpful. And sir, could you share how the overall customer mix has moved
over the year? I mean, has the share of salaried employees gone up, government employees gone
up? So, any share of the customer mix that you can give on how that was changed for the year?
Shashank Srivastava: Yes. So, we did see the salaried customer going up a little bit, about 2 percentage points. Largely
the government salaried class going up. So, if you look at the complete year, then I will just give
you those figures as well. By occupation, salaried customers for 2021 went to 45% - 46%,
slightly up; government was up to a little bit. And over the years, if you want, then the salaried
customer were roughly 44% 10 years back, but they had gone up to almost 47% in 2017-2018,
and last year it was 49%. Government customers out of these 25%, 10 years back was about
22%, 2017-2018; 24% last year, so it was up to 3%. Private salaried customers are also up 2%.
Business customers were down, so business customers which are normally 33% came down to
28% last year, mostly shop owners, in fact across all categories, trading, transportation,
contractors. And self-employed came down 1%; but the others, which is basically retired and
housewives and other people, they were consistent, in fact, went up slightly to 11%.
Sonal Gupta: Okay. Sir, thank you so much for this data point. And just my last question on what is the
investment in the third line at Gujarat, could you sort of share that number?
Ajay Seth: Immediately we don't have that information, we will get back to you.
