Coming to the business environment during the quarter,
The Company entered this quarter with adequate network stock in anticipation of good demand
in the festive period. During the quarter, as expected the company could maximise the retail
sales. As a result, the company had about 5 days of network stock at the end of the Q3 FY23.
Pending customer orders stood at about 363,000 vehicles at the end of this quarter out of which
about 119,000 orders were for recently launched models.
In Q3 FY23, the supply shortage of electronic components had marginally increased in
comparison with Q2 FY23. The Company could not produce about 46,000 vehicles in Q3 this
year. Limited visibility on availability of electronics components is a challenge in planning our
production. The electronics component shortages are still limiting our production volumes. Our
Supply Chain, Engineering, production and sales teams are working towards maximizing the
production volume from available semi-conductors. The supply situation of electronic
components continues to remain unpredictable.
