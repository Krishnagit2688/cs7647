: We take the next question is from Ashish Jain from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Ashish Jain: Sir, my first question was on the 6 airbag norms, which is now pretty much seem it's effective from first
of October. So, can you speak a bit about what is the cost implication? And also, if you go by media
articles and Maruti will have to do a lot more designing in all, especially on the entry-level of the car.
So, any update on that would be very helpful.

MSIL Conference Call Transcript 27 July 2022Rahul Bharti: It's a draft notification, and we believe the government is also studying and the auto industry body, SIAM,
is in discussion with the Government. It has many facets. The overall safety, factors of safety involved,
the cost, affordability, the semiconductor feasibility, etc. So, we are in discussion with the Government.
And the moment we have some concrete idea, we'll let you know.
Ashish Jain: And sir, second question was going ahead, can you speak a bit about what is the lag impact of both
commodity and price hikes that could come through in Q2 based upon how the way commodities are
trending today?
Ajay Seth: So, commodities, we mentioned that, definitely, it looks to be going down from these levels. And then
we have more certainty for quarter 2 because they come with a quarter lag. So, we know quarter 1
situation. So, we see downward trend in commodities. In the future also, we believe commodities should
not go up from these levels. But, again, it is very uncertain to say how much will it go down by or if there
is any geopolitical situation or anything, any sudden shortage, then we'll have to oversee. But overall
direction of commodities seems to be going down. Quantum, difficult to explain at this point in time. It
will depend on how the markets behave at a given point in time.
