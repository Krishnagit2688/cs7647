: We have our next question from the line of Kapil Singh from Nomura. Please go ahead.
Kapil Singh: Firstly, I just wanted to check on overall growth, what you are expecting for the full year and
given the situation and supply constraints, do you expect Maruti to do better than industry in this
financial year?
Rahul Bharti: So, of course, your answer is linked to the supply of semiconductors. So, given whatever we get
we should be able to produce and send to the market. Industry is expected to do about 3.8 million
this year.
Kapil Singh: The question was just trying to understand that order book is pretty high but the production has
not matched the order book. So, if you could just help us understand why that is happening?
Inventory has also increased. So, what is the technical issue here that we are facing?
Rahul Bharti: See, in the festive months, we do stock Besides, given the total semiconductor supplies, you can
maximize your production if you keep a slightly longer term view. So, we are keeping a view
till letâ€™s say end of December by which time we should be able to get both wholesales and retails
at a higher level given the overall semiconductor constraints. The idea is to maximize within the
constraint available if we improve the timeframe a bitt.
Kapil Singh: And secondly I just wanted to check given your experience with strong hybrid and the kind of
demand you are seeing, are you looking to add more models with strong hybrid option?
Rahul Bharti: Slightly premature. Yes, obviously over a longer period of time, that would be the intent. But
we will get more feedback from the consumer and from our manufacturing experience,
obviously, the efforts will be in that direction. And because it helps majorly in CO2 reduction
also, so nothing that we can immediately offer to comment on, nothing specific, but that would
be the direction in the future.
