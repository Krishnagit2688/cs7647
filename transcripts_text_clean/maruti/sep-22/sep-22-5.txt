: We have our next question from the line of Amyn Pirani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Amyn Pirani: Sir, just to go back to the question on discounts and royalty, can you mention the discount per
vehicle number as well as the royalty number for the quarter? I know you answered the question
directionally, but can you give us the numbers also.
Ajay Seth: So, discounts in this quarter were at INR 13,840 per vehicle, and they were at INR 12,748 in the
first quarter. So, they are about INR 1,000 higher than the first quarter. They were obviously
much higher in the second quarter of last year. They were at about INR 18,500 in the second
quarter of last year. So, that was on discount. The royalty percentage last year was at 3.5%, now
it is at 3.8%. And the first quarter royalty was slightly lower than this which was between 3.6%
and 3.7%.
Amyn Pirani: And secondly, on your CapEx, I see that in your cash flow, I think you've already spent I think
INR 3,500 crore on CapEx for the first half. So, can you help us understand what's the full year
expectation number and what are the areas in which these spends are going? Is most of it going
towards the Haryana CapEx? Or is there some other areas where you're spending this money?
Ajay Seth: So, we will be spending upwards of INR 7,000 crore this year. And this includes of course, the
Kharkhoda facilities where now we've started our construction work. And also weâ€™ll have to
place orders to various vendors. So, that will be one major portion of CapEx. Besides that, all
the new model launches that we are doing where we have to have the investment on toolings, et
cetera, I think that will be another large piece of CapEx. So, these are two areas where the CapEx
will be maximum. Then you have the other routine capital expenditure on the other aspects of
the business, which is R&D, the regular maintenance CapEx. So, these are the key areas where
we will be spending.
