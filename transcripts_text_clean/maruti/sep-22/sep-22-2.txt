Maruti Suzuki celebrated ‘40 years of Suzuki’s partnership with the people of India’.
During the event, Hon’ble Prime Minister laid foundation stone of Suzuki Motor Gujarat electric
vehicle battery manufacturing facility at Hansalpur, Gujarat and Maruti Suzuki vehicle
manufacturing facility in Kharkhoda, Haryana.
The Company was incorporated to provide cars for the masses of India and also build a vibrant
manufacturing Industry in India. We are happy to share that the Company has been true to its
reason for existence even today.
If we look back, one of the key success factors in our journey has been the strong focus on
understanding and fulfilling the needs of customers by offering them relevant products,
technologies, and services. Over the years, customers have evolved and accordingly our
products, services, and business processes too have aligned, keeping the customers at the heart
of it.

management decisions are based on the long-term interests of our stakeholders.
Last but not the least, we have a very good blend of Indian and Japanese culture in our Company.
We were able to combine Japanese shop-floor practices and discipline with Indian innovation
and zeal in our operations. Our parent Suzuki, Japan, has been a silent support, trying to look at
the future from its global experience and carefully selecting the best technology and products
for Indian customers.
Coming to the recent new model launches,
• In September, the Company started retailing its newest flagship offering from NEXA,
the Grand Vitara. With over 75,000 bookings in a short span of time, customer
response for Grand Vitara is overwhelming. The Grand Vitara is a multi-product
offering with cutting-edge Intelligent Electric Hybrid powertrain, Progressive Smart
Hybrid technology and Suzuki ALLGRIP SELECT technology is designed to appeal
to a varied customer base and will revolutionize the SUV space in India.
• In August, the Company launched a full model change of its iconic brand Alto. The
All-New Alto K10 is loaded with host of comfort, safety, convenience and
connectivity features.
• The Company further strengthened its green vehicles’ portfolio by introducing S-CNG
powertrain technology in Swift and S-Presso. With this, Maruti Suzuki now offers 10
vehicles with factory-fitted S-CNG technology. Maruti Suzuki’s Research &
Development facility conducts rigorous testing for its factory-fitted S-CNG cars to
deliver unmatched safety, performance, durability and fuel efficiency.
Going forward, the Company will stive to further strengthen its SUV portfolio to dominate the
SUV segment, just like all other segments.
Coming to the business environment during the quarter,
On the back of better availability of electronic components, the Company reported its highest
ever sales volume in any quarter. The electronics component shortages are still limiting our
production volumes. In this quarter, the Company could not produce 35,000 vehicles. Limited
visibility on availability of electronics components is a challenge in planning our production.
Our Supply Chain, Engineering, production and sales teams are working towards maximizing
the production volume from available semi-conductors. The supply situation of electronic
components continues to remain unpredictable.
Coming to the Highlights of Q2 (July-September), FY 2022-23
The Company sold a total of 517,395 vehicles during the quarter. Sales in the domestic market
stood at 454,200 units. Exports were at 63,195 units. The same period previous year was marked

379,541 units comprising 320,133 units in domestic and 59,408 units in export markets.
Pending customer orders stood at about 412,000 vehicles at the end of this quarter out of which
about 130,000 vehicle pre-bookings are for recently launched models.
During the quarter, the Company registered its highest-ever quarterly Net Sales of INR 285,435
million. During the same period previous year, the Net Sales were at INR 192,978 million.
The Operating Profit in quarter 2 FY2022-23 stood at INR 20,463 million as against INR 988
million in quarter 2 FY2021-22. The Operating Profit in Q2 of last year had dipped sharply
owing to steep commodity price increases and electronic component supply constraints and
hence results of Q2 FY2022-23 are not strictly comparable with those of Q2 FY2021-22. The
Company has been making simultaneous efforts in securing electronic components availability,
cost reduction and improving realization from the market to better its margins.
With this, the Net Profit for the quarter rose to INR 20,615 million from INR 4,753 million in
Q2 FY2021-22.
Coming to the Highlights of H1 (April-September), FY 2022-23
The Company sold a total of 985,326 units during the period. Sales in the domestic market stood
at 852,694 units. Exports in this half year were at 132,632 units. During the same period previous
year which is H1 FY2021-22, the Company registered a total sale of 733,155 units including
628,228 units in domestic market and 104,927 units in the export market. In addition to
electronic components shortage, the sales in H1 FY2021-22 were also severely affected due to
COVID related disruptions and hence results of H1 FY2022-23 cannot be compared with those
of H1 FY2021-22.
The Company registered Net Sales of INR 538,298 million in H1 FY2022-23, which is the
highest-ever half-yearly Net Sales. The Net Sales in H1 FY2021-22 were at INR 360,965
million.
The Company made a Net Profit of INR 30,743 million in the H1 FY2022-23 as against INR

have. Thank you.
