Thank you. The next question is from Reuters News, N R Sethuraman.
N R Sethuraman
Sir, could you please be more specific about like what exactly was the business in Russia and
what exactly are you moving out and you said like there is no impact on operations so if there
is no impact on operations, like what was the work earlier being done in Russia and what is the
impact of Finacle because you had been working with some clients for Finacle in Russia, Alfa-
10Bank was part of it right, like there was a blockchain environment that was created a couple of
years back and it was tested and what is the update on that and you said there is no plan to work
with clients going forward in Russia, which means there are a lot of major banks there on the
sanctions so what would be the impact of your financial services in banks business if you are
moving out of the region because it is all interlinked. Like in Europe would be more specific
about those operations that you are moving out and could you please also help me out on how
many resources were there in place in Russia and what exactly is the plan for them, is there any
sale you are considering for the Russia operations? I think it is not a 100% subsidiary for you?

Thanks for the question. I think the work we do is for few of our global clients that have
operations in Russia. We have less than 100 employees in Russia working with our clients. We
have initiated how we can transition all of that work outside of Russia. We have no work with
any Russian client today and we have no plans for any work with any Russian client going
ahead. Finacle of course works with companies but not in Russia so they work with banks all
over the world. That market was not a market that we were servicing in the past as well so we
have no active clients in Russia and no plans for anymore clients there. There are less than 100.

I think probably less than what are there in this room.
