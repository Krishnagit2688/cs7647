Thank you. The next question is from Kushal Gupta from Zee Business to Nilanjan. What are
the tools available at your end to safeguard the margins ahead, given the current scenario
remains like this for some more quarters?

Yes. So, I think four or five of them, which straightaway we know, I think our automation
capabilities are tremendous. I think it is the biggest source of our margin improvement. And of
course, with new tools coming in, I think we can see more-and-more productivity increases.
The one which is sitting out there really is utilization. I think at 80%, we know we have a large
headroom to improve that. Onsite offshore mix, which post-COVID, slightly went a skew
because, of course, there was some travel which went back. That now strategically can be
looked at and as we can offshore more work.
Definitely on the pyramid side as well. So, as freshers' go into the pyramid, you will get a
benefit really on the production workforce. So today, the bench has a double whammy on cost
because you have idle people and, of course, you have a rich pyramid in terms of a very top-
heavy pyramid. And as freshers' go in, you will be having that benefit as well.
So, there are multiple levers, which we have. Pricing is one of them. Salil mentioned that as
well. We continue to work with our clients where we can put COLA clauses into our deals,
where we can sell with new innovative commercial constructs. Of course, the environment is
tough. The good news is we have not seen, for instance, a return back to a heavy discounting
environment. We are making sure that we are continuing to push back on our clients on
discounts, etc., and that really has stayed even during this time.
