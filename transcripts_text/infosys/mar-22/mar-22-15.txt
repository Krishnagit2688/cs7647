Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question for today. I now hand the
conference over to the management for closing comments.

Thank you everyone for joining us. I wanted just to reiterate a couple of points we all
discussed and mentioned. First FY2022 was an extremely strong year for us â€“ close to 20%
growth, 23% margin. We are clearly taking market share and really connecting very strongly
with our clients for all the digital and cloud work.
As we go ahead we want to focus on the ever expanding opportunity set in cloud, digital,
data, analytics, automation, and in doing that we want to make sure that we remain a leader in
the pack and continue the market share taking that we have been doing. We also want to
focus on our employees with increased engagement and increased methods of working with
their compensation increases and career progressions. Putting all of that together we come to
a growth guidance of 13% to 15% for this financial year 2023 and a margin guidance of 21%
28to 23%. We have a strong outlook and we look forward to working with our clients and
employees for this outlook to be delivered in financial year 2023.
Thank you again everyone for joining and look forward to catching up during any of the one-
on-ones in the quarter. Take care.
