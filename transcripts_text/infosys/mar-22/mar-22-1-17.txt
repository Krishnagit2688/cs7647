Shilpa, you had a question?
Shilpa Phadnis
Yes. The revenue productivity has dropped sharply. And that too, it’s on a consolidated basis
with all the subsidiaries added. It’s $53,400 vis-à-vis, $57,000, nearly $58,000 last year. So, if
you can help us understand that – revenue productivity per employee?

So, this is just your total revenue by headcount. And in a way, our utilization, if it's down from
88% to 80%, straightaway, mathematically, you have a 10% reduction. So, that's just the impact
of utilization. So, we are just carrying many more freshers than we did last year. That is as
simple as that.

And in terms of the renewals, are clients taking longer than usual to renew? And hence, the
revenue recognition hasn't happened. Is that one of the reasons why you see more slower
closures?
Salil Parekh
There, what we are seeing is in a large deal pipeline, we have seen an expansion in the time to
close a deal. So, it's not specific to a renewal or to something new. It's more that in the large
deal pipeline, we have seen that. And then once it's closed, then it flows in, once it's closed,
there is no other constraint on how the project starts and so on.
