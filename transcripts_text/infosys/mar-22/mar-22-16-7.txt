Thank you. The next question is from Reshab Shaw from Deccan Herald.

Hi gentlemen. So, my question is have you gained market share from some of your bigger
rivals, and you spoke about attrition, but is the worst behind us, and the third question is, so
you spoke about Russia, but in Eastern Europe what is your presence?

11On market share, we are clearly gaining market share in our view at 19.7% growth - from what
we understand, we are one of the fastest growing. All of this growth was based on an organic
basis and we see the tremendous traction we have with clients and that gives us an increase in
the market share.
On attrition as Nilanjan shared in the quarter, the attrition was about five percentage points
lower than in the previous quarter and everything we see gives us a view that attrition is coming
more and more into the range that we would become comfortable with. We will see how that
progresses. We are actively working on many of the initiatives that are helping on this.
