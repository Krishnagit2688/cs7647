Thank you, we have a couple more questions on attrition and client spending I just read it out,
this is from Zee Business. We have seen attrition levels rising across IT companies and it has
been similar for your company as well. When do you see this easing and what is your strategy
to control and on the client part how do you see client spending for FY23 and in which vertical
do you see the highest spending coming?

15On the attrition we have already given a view on it, what we see today is attrition having come
down five percentage points in the quarter. We also see as we look ahead many of the
initiatives, we put in place whether it is greater employee engagement, the compensation
reviews, different ways of people working on projects, different rates in which we go through
various carrier progressions, some of them starting to have impact now and some over the
course over the next few quarters. We feel attrition is definitely something which we have seen
a small decline from the previous quarter, and we will watch it to see how it plays out in the
quarters ahead.
In terms of the client spend we see today our pipeline is actually very strong, we see in all of
our discussions, clients are more and more ready to spend much more focused on the cloud
area, very much on the data analytics business, on IoT, and lots of discussion on automation
which also has impact in cost and efficiency. So, in all of the elements where we have strength,
we see good traction with client discussions and client spends.
