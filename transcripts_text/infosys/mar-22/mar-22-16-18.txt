Thank you, the last question is from CNBC TV18 once more, Reema Tendulkar asks you
alluded to an impact due to a client contract, which you expect to get reversed? Can you
quantify the heat on revenue and margins due to this?

At this stage, we will not quantify any of those specifics within that as Nilanjan shared and in
one of the questions earlier mentioned is a one off contractual impact. We see very strong
volume growth in Q4 and we see 22,000 new employees joining. Good demand going ahead
and a good growth outlook with our guidance at 13% to 15%.
