Thank you. Salil, we have just a couple more questions, one is from The Economic Times.
Surabhi Agarwal says could you talk about a bit in detail about the demand environment and
client spending in the coming years especially where is the demand coming from which
verticals given the COVID situation and the geopolitical situation and also is the 20% growth
19reported this year is it sustainable or a one off and what would you attribute this 20% growth
to?

So on the demand environment, we see good demand across many industries and there are
different dynamics in each of the industries. So you look at HiTech businesses, they are looking
to really connect with their customers in a different way, in a faster way and we are part of that.
They are trying to rework their supply chains given all of that is going on globally and we are
a part of those discussions. We see good demand in Financial Services which is our largest
industry segment. There we are part of areas where this is really Ops and Tech transformation
programs where clients are looking to have someone who can help them with the
transformation of their operations while we infuse technology and create a modernized estate
for them. We have good demand in the Manufacturing segment where we see clients looking
at leveraging the IoT infrastructure, leveraging what is going on with the cloud and the data
center evolutions. So the demand is broad based across many of our industry segments today
and we see that looking good in terms of our pipeline as we look out to this financial year.
