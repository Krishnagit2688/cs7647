Thank you. The next question is from BQ Prime. Tushar has sent us two questions, one for
Salil and one for Nilanjan. For Salil, what is the rationale behind the revision in guidance, given
the weakness in the BFSI space? For Nilanjan, how do we see deal-making and margin panning
out over the next two quarters? Is growth likely to return in a hurry?
Salil Parekh
So, on the first one, in that sense, there is no revision in the guidance because it is the start of
our financial year. So that is our guidance for the year. There is no revision in our guidance.
Nilanjan Roy
Yes, I mean, I think, we see the guidance in the context of the macro environment, which we
are sitting in now, right? And that, of course, can change. But the other thing is we have a very
strong pipeline. In fact, our large-deal pipeline is the strongest ever we have had. And in a way,
that gives us the confidence, at least as the year progresses, that we will have some conversion
of this. And the second half of the year, we will definitely see a definite improvement, which
is why the four to seven band, we have widened that band exactly for that reason.
