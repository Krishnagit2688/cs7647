Rukmini, thanks. Jochelle had a question. Shilpa, one sec. Jochelle had a question, and after
Shilpa's, we'll close the conference.
Jochelle Mendonca
So, it's a broader question. Over the past few months, we have seen companies say that they
have record high deals, strong deal wins, and with Accenture announced 19,000 job cuts, or in
the case of TCS, say, the market is still uncertain, and have issues with not as strong growth as
maybe the market had expected. Could you give some color on why there may be this
disconnect between strong demand and high deals, and good deal wins and large deals, that's
not somehow flowing into the revenue line?

Jochelle, it'll be difficult for me to comment on those two companies.
Jochelle Mendonca
No, I mean a broader industry thing, because I think, you have had good deal wins this quarter.
It's not terrible deal wins for Infosys.

For us, I think, for Infosys, we have had very strong year in terms of wins, $9.8 bn, and that is
what we see the growth guidance that we have given, 4% to 7%. Then we saw in the quarter
some of the ramp-down. So, there is always some additions, and then this what we had not seen
at the end of last quarter, those ramp-down. So, then we balance those two things as we give
the guidance.
Jochelle Mendonca
Slowdown is so bad that it's offsetting the remarkable deal wins we saw in the quarter?
Salil Parekh
There, the way we look at it is, we had very good large deal wins. And then we had some clients
where we had ramp-downs.
