Thank you. Next question is from Sai from The Economic Times.

Hi, gentlemen. So, looking at the guidance, I just wanted to ask, even last year, you had given
guidance and you had kept updating it, right? So, would you call this some sort of a misstep
like kind of seeing the demand forecast as overestimating demand? And also, I wanted to know
you were saying that a lot of project cancellations and the one-time impact were there. So, has
that impact subsided, or should we also expect similar pressure in the pipeline that's coming?
Also, for Nilanjan, I wanted to know the campus hiring target for FY’24. Thanks.

Many of the things that Nilanjan and I shared earlier today were things that happened in the
quarter. For example, some of the clients decided to slow down or stop some of the projects.
So, these were things we had not seen at the start or at the end of last quarter, and that's what
we felt. We have also seen some of that stabilizing in March, but the demand environment is

uncertain. So, we are making sure that we keep that in mind as we look ahead and remain agile
as we look ahead.

So, on the freshers, like I said, we have a very rich bench now. We have hired more than 50,000,
and we have said, we will hire 50,000. We actually had, I think, hired 51,000-odd last year.
And a lot of them on the bench are getting skilled, are getting trained. So, we have quite a
leeway for the next few quarters in terms of the availability of freshers. And of course, with
our agile model of doing both college and off-campus recruitment, we can always turn that up.
So, we have no specific number for FY’24 at this stage. We have enough, actually, today sitting
on the bench.
