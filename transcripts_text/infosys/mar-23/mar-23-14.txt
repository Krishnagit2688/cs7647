Hi, good evening and thanks for taking my question. You've seen some divergence in
the client behavior that we have talked about versus what some of our larger peers
have spoken about. One, we have seen march stabilizing while what we heard
yesterday was march actually deteriorated?
And second, the discretionary spend for peers have actually got deferred and not
canceled, while we have seen certain cancellation in the project. So in that context,
just wanted to understand the nature of these projects which are being cancelled, are
these discretionary or there are also vendor consolidation deals

What we shared was that some of the projects or programs were stopped in an
unplanned way during the course of the quarter. These are not resulting from vendor
consolidation. These are resulting from decisions that the clients have typically made
on their spends given the environment that they are faced.
Abhishek KumarOkay, sure. Thank you and all the best.
