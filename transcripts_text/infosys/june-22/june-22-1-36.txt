I am sure, my questions will not please you all but I cannot stop myself from asking them.
Firstly why this press conference is being held on a Sunday? Secondly, why this show-off
event, on the issue of a non-compete clause, why have you not honored the summons of the
elected government. Thirdly, I think Nilanjan can talk about it. Is the salary hike of Mr. Salil
is it in line with Narayana Murthyâ€™s philosophy. He had once said, It is inappropriate to
increase the salaries of top executives when lower levels do not get them? These are my three
questions.
Salil Parekh
Thank you for your questions. The second one I did not get. It cut off. The first one was why
we doing it on Sunday? The way we had our board meeting which wrapped up just earlier
today and given that this was information we were sharing right away in terms of our press
note we thought it was appropriate to make sure we answer questions from anyone from the
18press that had a question for us with respect to the result so that is why we had it pretty much
as soon as our board meeting concluded. I am sorry I did not catch the second one and third
one relates to me so I will request Nilanjan to address.
Nilanjan Roy
On the third one, like I said the board decides very extensively on benchmarking. In fact, we
have given out a three-page statement on the reason for the increase in compensation and I
think more importantly the overwhelming support of all shareholders across the world - from
promoters, everybody I think about close to 98%. This in my view would probably be the
highest sort of reaffirmation of the compensation for Salil which have been completely
globally benchmarked as well. So I would encourage you to read the statement of as part of
the annual results and the transparency we have given on all the metrics around which the
reward will be given.
