The second question was on non-compete and why we have not attended the summons.
Salil Parekh
On the non-compete, our HR leadership, the leadership from the company are working very
closely with the respective authorities both locally and centrally. Our teams are making sure
that the specific position that the company has which is essentially related to making sure that
if and when an employee leaves, the client confidentiality of the work that is of utmost
importance is observed. We have no constraints within anything within the company which
precludes anyone from choosing what they want to do and we have had extensive discussions
and meetings with the appropriate authorities.
