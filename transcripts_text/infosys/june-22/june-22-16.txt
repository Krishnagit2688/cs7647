Thanks for taking my question. Salil this is on mega deals while the industry frequency tends
to be low and it has been a while for Infosys it will be good to know your comments on mega
deals from a pipeline perspective and secondly on pricing how is the ability to get price
increase versus last quarter do you see any changes to that?
Salil Parekh
From the mega deals, I think again we do not share anything specific in terms of what we
publish. The color from our side is we have mega deals in our pipeline, if that will give you a
context.
On the pricing, we have seen pricing currently holding in our deal values for Q1. My sense is
we have seen examples that Nilanjan was sharing earlier where we are working, we have
worked with clients to demonstrate to them the impact of compensation increases and that has
translated to COLA or price benefits. We have had examples where we have had increases,
which are related to the digital high value work that we are driving for clients. We now have
to make sure we take that across a whole portfolio and see the benefits coming into our
business. Typically the salary increase happens at a periodic time and these things where we
29have not seen a high inflation environment like this for over 40 years in the western markets
that takes a longer time. That is what as Nilanjan shared is part of what we have put in place
to support our margin as we go ahead.
Apurva Prasad
Thank you for that.
