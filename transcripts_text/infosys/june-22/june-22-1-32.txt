The next question is from Sethuraman from Reuters News. Sethuraman joins us on audio.

Good evening gentlemen. Thanks for your time. Sir I just wanted to hear back on the gross
client additions that were kind of low on QoQ as well as year-on-year and the TCV also saw
a bit of softness so is this starting of the soft period is it like because I see that like you said
your large client traction remains very good, so I just wanted to know like whether you are
seeing softness in terms of smaller deals are concerned like adding new clients because of the
macro environment?

Today, for us the way we are seeing the demand and the strength of Q1 in terms of our
overall growth and the volume growth that gives us the confidence to increase our revenue
guidance as we have done. In terms of what we see with clients, in terms of the additions,
large deals in our experience are volatile, some quarters they are high, some quarters they are
low but the pipeline for it today looks in good shape and that is what giving us the view in
terms of increasing our guidance.
