Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Manik Taneja from JM Financial. Please go
ahead.

Thank you for the opportunity and sorry for harping on the margin question once again. I just
wanted to understand how should we be thinking about the segmental or the improvement in
segmental margins for manufacturing vertical given the sharp drop that we have seen over the
last three quarters and how does that heal in terms of the overall margin outlook? Thank you.

Somebody else has asked a similar question and without going into any specifics, we have
seen that growth coming out of a large deal in manufacturing and like you said as we look at
the tenure of these large deals in some cases they start off with lower than portfolio margins
because clients may ask for savings upfront but we have already started plan in terms of over
28quarter-on-quarters what do we need to do to bring back profitability because from day one
clients come to us because they know we can optimize the cost structure. So that is something
which is generically what we have been doing and since we started the large deal strategy and
we have seen margin improvements over that period. So I think we are quite confident of the
future profile of these businesses.

Sure thank you.
