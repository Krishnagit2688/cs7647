Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please
go ahead.

Good morning. Thanks for the opportunity. I had two questions. One, is from a margin
perspective, whatever we saw as one offs in the previous quarter which included visa and
these contract provisions - both of them have been sort of offset in this quarter is that a fair
understanding? The second is in terms of salary increases is it only for the associate level this
quarter and if so then the question is that we have 145,000 associates JL3 and below and
130,000 people in the mid level and general understanding is mid level obviously as a
percentage of the employee cost it should be higher so the thought process was about should
not your margin impact be even higher next quarter - if you could just help with that thought
process that will be very helpful? Those are two questions. Thank you.

As I said in the margin walk, we had a benefit of 50 bps in RPP which is a combination of
clients contractual provisions reversals partially offset by the discounts. So we have seen a
benefit there. There is no way we said that has it been eroded, we have caught the benefit of
client contractual provisions clearly.
16The other one on visa, travel - I think they largely offset each other. On the outlook on wages,
we have done it for most of our employees, it is up to mid level. For more of the senior levels
is what we are going to roll out in July and that impact would be far less than 1.6% which we
have done which is a much more broad based for us.

Both associates and mid level happen this quarter itself. It is not only associate.
Nilanjan Roy
Yes, associates and mid level, correct.
Nitin Padmanabhan
Correct that is very helpful. Thank you so much.
