Good evening gentlemen, so Salil I would ask about the demand outlook first to you because
in the US and particularly Europe if we see, there are things like inflation and other concerns,
particularly on the growth factor, there are peers they going into recession so probably maybe
the demand outlook might be slowing down there going ahead, so are we looking at other
geographies to grow and keep our pipelines healthy. And secondly on the localization front as
to how are we moving ahead with localization in Australia and other geographies as well.
Salil Parekh
On the other geographies, I think we have within our pipeline a good demand outlook on
large deals within the US market, within the European market. We have seen really strong
growth this quarter in Europe. Yes, we are looking at other geographies. We have had
historically a very good business in Australia which also has today a good pipeline. We
continue to expand with strategic partnerships in Japan and in Singapore. So those are
markets that we are looking at and those have been some of the markets that have been part
of our strategic plan as we have gone through this. Even within Europe, we did an acquisition
a few days ago that we announced which was a company focused on Life Sciences in
Denmark. So we are looking more and more at Denmark and countries in the Scandinavian
Region which are giving us good growth and also good opportunity. So those things will
continue across the different geographies we talked about.
8In terms of localization that is something that has been an ongoing program that we have
driven. A lot of it has been driven as you referenced in many of the western geographies - in
the US, in Europe is also something that is moving along well in the Australian geography.
