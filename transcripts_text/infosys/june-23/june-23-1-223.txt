I think we have difficulty hearing Mr. Satish. Now, may I request, Ms. Suman Agarwal?
Suman Agarwal, can you kindly go ahead and ask your question?
Suman Agarwal
Very good evening, Chairman Sir and all the Board members present. I am Suman Agarwal, member of
Millennium MAMS joining from Kolkata and a proud shareholder of our company.
Sir, I would like to understand how the company is going to grow in the next five years. Will it be
through inorganic growth, new verticals or the existing verticals? Please share your views. Thank you.
