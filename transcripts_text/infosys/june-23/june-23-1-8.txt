Thank you, Mr. Dharav. Now, may I request Ms. Shruti. Ms. Shruti, kindly go ahead and ask your
question.
Shruti Saraogi
Good afternoon, respected Chairman Sir, and members of the Board. I am Shruti Saraogi, a proud
shareholder of Infosys, folio number 300693 joining in from Kolkata, and a member of the Kolkata
chapter of Millennium Mams. I have two questions, Sir. An important part of our operations is human
resources. As we know, there is a shortage and attrition rates are high in the industry. Do you think it
- 17 -would be a good HR policy to provide accommodation? Theoretically, if we put up a campus in Mysore
with the new Mysore-Bangalore highway, the distance is only one hour. This could be on the lines of
the GIFT city in Gujarat, where all facilities are available. This would help reduce attrition rates. Please
share your views on that. Secondly, about AI replacing humans in many work areas and being a
threat. On which side of the opinion spectrum are you and why? Thank you so much, Sir.
