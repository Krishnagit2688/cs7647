Mr. Manoj, kindly go ahead and ask your question.
Good afternoon, Sir.
Yes, we can hear. Kindly go ahead Sir.
Manoj Kumar
First question is what is our future outlook on core? Number one, how are we are geared up to tackle
upcoming recession in the US and European market and adverse impact of foreign currencies? Second
one is what are our plans to achieve sustainable financial growth and next point is return on earning
targets for upcoming three to five years. That is what I just want to understand. And another one is that
question has already been answered I think. How are we geared up for the technical disruption?. So
that, with Salil Sir’s good presentation, I got the answer well in advance.
Last question is while going through the Balance Sheet and P&L, I was just wondering what is the
reason for 84% increase in travel expenses, and what is the reason for 60% increase in cost of
software Y-o-Y. I found that these two are major factors which have brought gone down our profitability
by 2%.
Although, there is an increase in revenue from operations of 20%, our PBT has dropped by 2%. I feel
these are the two major causes – 84% increase in traveling expense and 60% increase in cost of
software Y-o-Y. So, I just want to understand the reason for that. Thank you.
