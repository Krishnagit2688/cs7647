Thank you, Mr. Om Prakash. May I now request Srirama Vinoda Adilakshmi? Maâ€™am, kindly go ahead
and ask your question.
Srirama Vinoda Adilakshmi
Good evening, Chairman Sir and members of the Board. I'm a member of Millennial Mams, Bangalore
Chapter, and a proud shareholder of Infosys. I would like to ask you two questions. My first question is,
recession is looming large in America. It is affecting revenues, given that the North American business
grew only 6%. Sir, in this condition, what is your view about Infosys in the next three years? And my
second question is how is Infosys investing in employee upskilling and reskilling to adapt to emerging
technologies and meet changing client demands? Thank you.
