Dharav Jamedar
Yeah. Good evening and greetings of the day to the respected Chairman and all the Board members of
the company. My name is Dr. Dharav Jamedar. I'm from Surat, Gujarat. My DP ID is IN303028. First of
all, I would like to congratulate each and every stakeholder of my Company on performing
tremendously well, outperforming the peers and posting robust numbers, both on Q-o-Q and Y-o-Y
basis. Sir, every year it is an honor and a memorable moment to get an opportunity to have an
insightful conversation with you on different aspects. I would also like to acknowledge and appreciate
the efforts of corporate secretarial department. Some of my questions which I would request you to
address are first, apart from the cloud capabilities and differentiated digital services, which segment
might be the third pillar to the stellar growth in the coming years. Second, what is my Company's
strategy of maintaining higher ROE despite suffering from the issue of lower margins? Third, how is my
Company going to improve its free cash flow conversion in this particular fiscal year? Fourth, apart from
leveraging more on generative AI capability, what are the steps that my Company is taking to improve
the productivity within the company?Fifth, considering the company's BFSI segment has only 2%
exposure in USAâ€™s regional banks, which segment of yours do you think shall be highly and which
segment will be least impacted by the case, case being that US goes in recession? Six, what according
to you, shall be the role of IT services five years down the line factoring in all the recent developments
of AI and many such things related to it? Seven, what steps has my company taken for the well-being
of its employees in this last fiscal year? I wish all the best to my Company for this current fiscal year.
Thank you, Sir.
