question.

Yeah. So good evening, everyone. I am honored to have the opportunity to speak with you all today. I
want to start by thanking the Board of Directors for giving me this chance to addressyou all once again.
As many of you will remember, my name is Kaushik Sowcar, and I'm a chartered accountant from
Mumbai. I have been facing physical challenges due to dystonia, which has affected half of my body
paralyzed, impacted my right hand, my right leg and speech. However, I have not let this challenge
impact my passion for accounting. However, I do need your support to continue to be self-reliant. I have
been reaching out to you for last few years. But it seems that my request has gone unheard. I
understand that you may be having been busy with other things, important things. But I would like to
know the reason why my request has not been given the attention it deserves. I want to make it clear
that I'm not looking for any freebies, free money. I'm simply asking for help to ensure that I continue to
work to the best of my abilities. As a practicing chartered accountant, I value independence and self-
reliance, and I hope that you can appreciate my desire to maintain the independence. Thank you for
considering my request. I strongly believe that with your support, I can make significant contribution to
our organization and positively impact society. I eagerly await your response and sincerely appreciate
the time and attention you have given me today. If you're interested and willing, I would greatly
appreciate the opportunity to meet you in person. Thank you. Thank you so much.
