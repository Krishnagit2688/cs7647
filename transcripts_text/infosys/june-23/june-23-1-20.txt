Thank you, Sir.
May I now request Mr. Srikantha?Sir, kindly go ahead and ask your question.
Srikantha
Respected Chairman, MD, Board of directors, employees of Infosys and fellow shareholders,
namaskar.
So, I was in for a very pleasant surprise when I met my auditor few days ago while I was filing my IT
returns. The IT portal has been done so well, so effective by our own company, that earlier we had to
give all the details to our auditor, like what are our earnings, expenses and everything. But now, to my
surprise, everything is captured there. Even a small amount of ₹25 dividend from a company is
captured there. This is fantastic. My congratulations and applause to the team who have done the hard
- 28 -work here. And in fact, I remember last year, there were a lot ofglitches and trouble, but you're able to
overcome everything and this is quite wonderful. I think all the auditors would be very happy. With that,
I have only two questions.
Sir, Infosys is known for giving special dividends on reaching each and every milestone. I remember
when Infosys reached 25 years’ operations, they declared a fantastic special dividend. Likewise for 30
years. Now that you have completed 40 years, I am yet to hear something of that. So please, please do
that. And coming to the question. This question was asked by a few shareholders regarding this
buyback. See when Infosys announced a buyback of ₹1,850 per share, and it went to the market for the
buyback and got it around ₹1,500 or so, why was this done? See, instead of going for a buyback, you
could have awarded the shareholders with a special dividend. These are my two questions. Thank you,
Sir. Namaste.
