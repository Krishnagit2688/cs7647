question.
Hiranand Kotwani
Thank you. Thank you. It's great pleasure to join you, Infosys. Highly respected and humble, our
Chairman and other dignitaries attending this meeting. So many questions have been asked, nothing
more to add. Just one question to Mr. Chairman, because his address was too good. And Salil has
already given us a picture. The question remains not to ask. But, certainly I have one question
regarding to the fluctuation in dollar. Mr. Chairman, what is the contingency plan, if the dollar crashes?
How you will see the future growth of industry, particularly IT, globally? How the growth and future of
our organization will be? Thank you and good luck ahead.
