Thank you, Malavika. The next question is from Shilpa. Shilpa go ahead, please.
Shilpa Phadnis - Times of India
Your offshore effort increased to 76% that is significantly higher and the recent ISG finding shows
that the supply side talent crunch is not impacting the pricing of contracts, so do you think the
automation is causing this decoupling and second question is on attrition, hiring new talent and
rehiring some of them and backfilling them, would mean higher cost especially when there is a
war for technology talent, if we can talk about what kind of retention measures have really worked,
not just for top performers. There is also widening MRE employee gap to the management, are the
benefits more skewed towards senior management and not the junior employees? Thank you.

On the first one, the point with respect to attrition, I think the focus there in terms of how we work
and make sure that we are fulfilling client need is what Pravin was sharing earlier. We have a
program which allows us to bring in a lot of employees, that we have now set a target for 35,000
college graduates worldwide that will join us and be deployed. We also have different mechanisms
which are focused on making sure that all of the employees have a much greater engagement, a
clear career path, a lot more of focus on reskilling, as we move to the digital skill sets, a
specialized program where there are digital tags which enable employees to get specialized
bonuses, compensation, projects and of course the focus that we discussed on promotions. We
think all of these things help us as we shared earlier with the net increase of 8,000 employees in
the quarter to demonstrate that our brand, our approach to bringing talent in is still extremely
relevant and therefore we are able to fulfill what our client needs are and grow at the pace at which
we are growing here.
