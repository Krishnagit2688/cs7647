Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from CLSA. Please go
ahead.
Pankaj Kapoor
Yes. Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. So, my first question is on the smaller deals, which
are less than, say, $50 mn TCV. If you can give some qualitative color on how your
win and pipeline in that basket has been moving? Is it higher, lower versus, say, what
it was six months back?
Salil Parekh
Thanks for the question. We don’t typically disclose much about those deals. Overall,
we have a good healthy pipeline while we publicly disclose more about the larger deals.
Pankaj Kapoor
Understood. And Salil my second question is on these cost takeout deals. Can you give
some sense on how the pricing in such deals behaving? Are you seeing the pressure
there more than normal, either because clients are pushing for more discounts or
because of competitive intensity?
Salil Parekh
So there, the pricing in Q3, we have seen quite stable within the mix, we have not seen
a change. Typically, it is really a function of what type of focus that clients have, which
industry they are in, as we have not seen, at least in Q3, in the deals that we have closed
in the discussion we have had, a big change on that. It looks stable at this stage.
Pankaj KapoorThank you and wish you all the best for ’24.
