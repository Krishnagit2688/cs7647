Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first
question is from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. It
looks like Mr. Katri’s line is dropped. In the meanwhile, we will move to our next
question, that is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Investec. Please go ahead.
Nitin Padmanabhan
Yes. Hi, good evening and thank you for the opportunity. My question was around the
increase in cost of software packages, that is up by almost $69 mn sequentially. How
should we think of this cost, do you think this incremental $69 mn will be a sticky
number out there or do you think it’s sort of representing the headwind -- instead come-off going forward? And is this sort of a pass-through in nature, that is the second sort
of clarification on the same thing? Thank you.
Nilanjan Roy
Yes, Nitin. So the $69 mn is a combination of software, it is other deals which we do
which have DaaS etcetera. It could be infrastructure. So, these are part of our integrated
services offering. These come with both manpower component and sometimes they also
come with an attachment of these services. So that is the way we do it. It’s an integral
part of our service offering.
We have to see where we end up for Q4, but I think, this is part of our overall offering
and it is actually giving us traction in the market in many of our service lines.
Nitin Padmanabhan
Sure. So it is a pass-through in nature in a way, is that correct? And basically, at least
earlier in the past, we have suggested that the new level would sort of sustain. So, in
the new operating model, this is sort of sticky thing that continues, is that assessment
fair – longer time?
Nilanjan Roy
Like I said this is integrated with our services offering, so they are not just standalone
deals we do, they come with the service element as well. So that is the way you have to
look at these deals.
Nitin Padmanabhan
Sure, fair enough. Thank you so much and all the best.
