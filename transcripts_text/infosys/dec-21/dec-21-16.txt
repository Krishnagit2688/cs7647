Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question for today. I now hand the
conference over the management for closing comments.
Salil Parekh
Thank you everyone. This is Salil. Just to close from our side. First, thank you all for making
your time. We feel extremely good about the quarter, 7% growth QoQ, 21.5% in YoY, very
strong digital 42.6%, very good on large deals $2.5 bn. So overall we see excellent market
demand and we are seeing market share gains which is a very good sign for us, primarily which
are coming from a well positioned portfolio and a good execution from all our teams. Our
revenue guidance of course has gone up from 19.5% to 20%, operating margins remains at a
good level at 23.5% and we have good strong trust and confidence of our clients. Overall, a
strong outlook and positive about what we see in the future for our digital and cloud
transformation programs.
With that thank you all wish you a Happy New Year and look forward to catching up in April.
Sandeep Mahindroo
