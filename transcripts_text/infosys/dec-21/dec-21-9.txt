ahead.

Good evening to the management team, happy New Year and thanks for taking my question.
First, congratulations on a very good set of numbers. Salil, I have a very simple question, you
see now you know, our core which is 41% to 42% of the business is stabilizing on a YoY basis,
it is probably little growth is there, but digital continues to be at 40% plus growth, so if this
trend continues next year, may be our core may become 32% to 33% of the overall pie, so what
is your sense from a long term perspective, where do you see this core stabilizing or do you
think it will be unfair to see them separately and in the next two to three years you think
everything will converge together. So, any idea, anything which you can say on that front will
be very helpful.

Thanks for that question. First as you pointed out, the digital growth is strong at over 40% or
42% and that shows resilience, the demand profile and our portfolio which is overlapping. The
key for the core, instead of looking at the percentage of the business, the key for us is really the
17core is now stable with a very small growth, so we did not see the decline that we had for some
quarters and this makes it extremely strong for us. We have probably the best capability in
automation and modernization across the industry and with this while everyone elseâ€™s core is
still shrinking, ours will be stable or possibly even have a small uptick and that means we will
be the most competitive in this area. So, I am looking at this as a very positive step. We of
course have to maintain this, and we have to keep building out our automation capabilities. So,
if we succeed in that, I think that is a very good outlook for us in the quarters ahead.

Thanks that is very helpful and best of luck for the current quarter.
