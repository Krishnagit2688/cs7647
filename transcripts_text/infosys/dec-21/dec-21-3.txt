Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question
is from the line of Ankur Rudra from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.

Thank you. Happy New Year to everybody. Excellent numbers for the quarter. Clearly a very
strong growth for Q3. Could you start with elaborating on â€“where did the incremental surprise
come from. The full year guidance has increased sharply given the performance of the quarter,
so where did the surprise come from?

I think what we are seeing in the quarter and then all through the year, is the demand
environment remains extremely strong and then more and more traction on the digital and the
cloud programs. This is where we saw the most impact in the quarter in Q3 where we had really
strong growth of 7% and therefore the overall guidance jumping up by 3%.
In terms of verticals, as I was sharing earlier, it is broad based. Of course, we have a very strong
momentum in Manufacturing, that was something that we were looking forward to. There is
also good momentum that we are seeing in Financial Services given it is our largest vertical,
and in Life Sciences that I described before. Retail is starting to come back nicely as well. As
Nilanjan mentioned, Europe again was a stand-out. Those are some of the elements that gave
us a good outcome in Q3 and then the support for expanding the guidance for the full year.
