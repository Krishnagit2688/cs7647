Thanks Rishi. Good evening. Wish you all a Happy New Year. And trust you and your dear ones
are well and safe. Thank you for making the time to join us today.
I am delighted to share with you that we had an extremely strong quarter with 7.0% sequential
growth and 21.5% year-on-year growth in constant currency terms. Our year-on-year growth was
the fastest we have had in 11 years. The growth was broad-based across industries, service lines
and geographies, driven by our differentiated digital and cloud capability. This is a clear testament
to the enormous confidence clients have in us to help them accelerate their business
transformations. This outcome has been made possible by the relentless commitment from our
employees to these challenging times. I am extremely proud as well as grateful for their
extraordinary efforts in delivering success for our clients.
Our growth has been accompanied by resilient operating margins at 23.5%. We have delivered
these margins while we kept in the forefront our focus on our employees with increased
compensation and benefit. Our digital business grew by 42.6% and now is 58.5% of our overall
revenues. Within digital, our cloud work is growing faster, and our Cobalt cloud capabilities are
resonating tremendously with our clients.The strong overall performance stems from four years of sustained strategic focus on areas of
relevance for our clients in digital and cloud, continuing re-skilling of our people, and deep
relationships of trust our clients have with us. With the strong momentum in the business and the
robust pipeline that we see, we are increasing our annual revenue growth guidance which was
previously 16.5% to 17.5%, we are increasing to 19.5% to 20% in constant currency terms. Our
operating margin guidance remains at 22% to 24%.
