27Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question I now hand the conference back
to the management for closing comments.

Thanks everyone for joining us. Just a few comments from me to close out.
In summary, first we really have both engines in our business digital and core growing which
is very strong for us. Digital capabilities and Cobalt are resonating and core and automation
we believe we have industry leading set of capabilities and that makes us ready for the
evolving macro environment. We had large deals of $2.7 bn which we are delighted with and
we have a very strong margin performance of 21.5%. So margin is clearly part of our focus
and we have a strong internal cost program that will help us drive all of these things. Attrition
is coming down so we see a huge impact of the initiatives that we put in place sometime ago.
So overall we feel we have a good quarter and we are well position for the environment that
is coming ahead in whichever scenario that evolves in that environment.
Thank you all for joining and we will catch up in a quarter or so.
