The next question is from The Informist. How do you see the Q3 performance given the
macroeconomic situation? You have answered this in case you want to add more.

I think on Q3, we do not give quarterly guidance, we give annual guidance. We have taken our
growth guidance which has gone from 14% - 16% to 15% - 16%, which is at the higher end of
the growth guidance. We expect it to be in the 15% -16% bracket for the full year.
