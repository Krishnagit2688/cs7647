Thank you. The next question is from Deccan Herald. How is the overall pricing environment?
Are you looking at passing some of the costs to clients where cross currency movement has an
adverse impact? Will the current pricing power sustain in the second half of FY2023?

We have seen inflation across the world and the pandemic in some sort of way across
geographies. It is both across consumer prices and wage inflation. And of course, we are going
back to many of our clients, one being as part of the clauses which we have like COLA.
Sometimes we are going back as part of our digital pricing and trying to demonstrate the value
we are able to bring. For instance, in the cost takeout program and how that can be taken back
in terms of pricing or productivity with us. So, these are multiple conversations across each
client because clients are unique. They speak on tracks, there are T&M contracts, mid-cycle
contracts, and new contracts. But the good news is that we have seen a reduction in discounts
which is very visible. The kind of discount we would have on renewals, etc. earlier has
definitely come down. On the other hand, we are trying to position ourselves to increase our
prices on the digital rate card, at the same time demonstrating the value this talent can give. So,
the answer is yes, but this is a very long haul, and it will take time. It is not something which
we can flip the book on every quarter, but this is something which we are seeing some traction
in.
