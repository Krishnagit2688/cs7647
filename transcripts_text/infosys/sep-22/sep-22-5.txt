Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta from Ambit Capital. Please
go ahead.

Thanks for the opportunity. I had a question on what is happening in the manufacturing
vertical in terms of margins because we had a $46 mn incremental revenue addition but our
segmental profitability bumped up by almost $49 mn, so that seems to have helped our
margin by almost 100 bps plus, so wanted to get some color on what exactly is happening
there. And then a clarification on our cloud revenues you mentioned is now above $1 bn, so
is it on a quarterly basis or on an annual basis?

For the manufacturing margins, I think the same question many of you had in the previous
quarter, and we took heed of that advice and we have worked on making sure our
manufacturing margins across deals and large deals improve. And yes we have plans on how
12deals evolve over a period of time and that should give us comfort. This is what we have over
the last four to five years of how we approach large deals and large deal margin
improvements. And of course, the other cost optimization levers across the entire
manufacturing which helped the other sectors as well. The second question I did not clearly
get.
Ashwin Mehta
I want to get a sense in terms of the cloud revenues that you mentioned of $1 bn plus, is it for
this quarter?
Nilanjan Roy
It is for this quarter $1 bn plus.
Ashwin Mehta
Thanks and all the best.
