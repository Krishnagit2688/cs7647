Thank you. The next question is from The New Indian Express. Any plans to make work from
office mandatory as your peers are calling employees back to office? Or any plans to continue
the present work-from-home model? Also, are there any plans to increase local hiring in the
American and European markets?

I think what we have seen is that over the last several quarters all through COVID, our work-
from-home approach has been extremely effective for our clients and for our employees. We
have already seen a lot of our employees coming back. We have put in place in the past a very
flexible approach where employees really had a tremendous amount of choice. And we see this
traction of the employees coming back increasing week-on-week on its own. We want to make
sure that we build things in the future which keep this element of flexibility and make sure that
we address client-specific needs, but we want to make sure that it is something that our
employees are comfortable with.
