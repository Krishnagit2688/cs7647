Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for today. I now hand the
conference over to the management for closing comments.

First, thank you everyone, for joining us for this session. I want to reiterate just a couple of
points. One, on the demand side, we see a good environment and with all the points we
discussed and the way we see the market, we have increased our growth guidance from 12% -
14% to 14% - 16% for this year.
On the margin, we have a set of levers which we have deployed and are continuing to deploy
across the board, whether it is the mix, whether it is the utilization, whether it is a subcontractor
usage, whether it is the overall role mix and pyramid, whether it is now more value and pricing
on demand for higher demand skills. Plus there are some factors which relate to employee costs
and some of the travel coming back. When we mix all of that together, we have confidence that
we will be in that margin guidance of 22% - 24%. We will continue to drive the business in
that direction keeping in mind our clients, employees and shareholders. We look forward to an
exciting and a successful year and thank you again for joining us.
