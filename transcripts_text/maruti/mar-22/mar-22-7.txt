: The next question is from the line of Amyn Pirani from J. P. Morgan.
Amyn Pirani: Firstly, just a bookkeeping question. What was the Gujarat volumes in this quarter?
Rahul Bharti: Gujarat was about 165,000 in the quarter.
Amyn Pirani: My second question was in this quarter we have seen a sharp jump in other operating income. Is
there anything that you would like to highlight here as to what is it just volume linked?
Ajay Seth: Some of this is increase in the scrap sales rates etc. so the income has gone up because of that.
There is a one exceptional item of about INR 100 crores which is basically grouping issue which
is having an income as well as an expense. The way it has to be shown as accounting, it has to
be shown as expense as well as an income, you can’t net it off. So, therefore in this quarter you're
seeing that exceptional INR 100 crores coming in expenses as well as in other operating income.
Amyn Pirani: That's related to you maintaining the same ex-showroom price across the country and the GST
thing? Is that's related to that?
Ajay Seth: That's one reason. But it’s to do with some other adjustment in accounting that has been done
for expense and income. Therefore, you find this gap in this quarter but I think it will get
normalized moving forward.
