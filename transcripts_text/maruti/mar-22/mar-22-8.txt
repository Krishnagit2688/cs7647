: The next question is from the line of Joseph George from IIFL.
Joseph George: In relation to the retail number that you gave for the third quarter. On one hand you mentioned
that you have a very strong order book. What I notice is that the retail that you gave for the
quarter was about 373,000 which is about 30k lower than the wholesale. Why is that kind of a
mismatch when you have such a strong order book?
Rahul Bharti: See we have only about 40,000 closing stock. So, to that extent we have to work with variants
and colors etc. So that's the reason.
Joseph George: You got to do with the mix impact. So, does it mean that at the end of December you are zero
levels of inventory? I mean approximately.
Rahul Bharti: Last year we were working with good level of inventories, now our inventories have thinned
out.
Joseph George: The second thing I wanted to check was with respect to the chip issue. You mentioned that you
expect some impact in FY23 as well but would it be possible to indicate what percent would be
the hit? In the past, I remember in September-October-November you used to put out press
releases saying that in the next month you would work at 80% of your planned production or

near-term outlook is? If your plan production is ‘X’ because of chip shortage how much would
it come down by?
Rahul Bharti: The situation is quite dynamic. So, what we have done is we have given a general statement
through the year that this will be a challenge and we will keep trying to maximize our numbers.
Last year, in one particular month we were at 40%-60% so it was important to make a disclosure.
But generally chips will continue to be a challenge in this year also and of course we'll try to
maximize our numbers.
