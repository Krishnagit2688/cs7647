: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question
is from the line of Raghunandan NL from Emkay Global.
Raghunandan NL: Firstly, on the order book side, can you indicate what would be the current order book? I think
media has been indicating around 326,000. Also, can you share what was the retails in last
quarter? My second question was your peers have started launching hybrids, would you be going
ahead with hybrid launches in future, would your upcoming SUV's have hybrid options?
Rahul Bharti: You're right, the current order book is more than 3.2 lakhs and we hope we'll be able to fulfill
these orders fast. We don't want our customers to be waiting.
The retail number in Quarter 4 including LCV segment is 372,000 vehicles.
So, you talked about hybrids. Hybrids are a very powerful technology, which can work in
conjunction along with EVs to help reduce carbon and reduce oil import. They do about 30%-
40% of the job of an EV and are many times more scalable. It would be an interesting option
and weâ€™ll be looking forward to such technologies in the future.
Raghunandan NL: Would you be able to quantify how severe could be the RM cost impact for June quarter given
the last 2 months commodity inflation?
Ajay Seth: Difficult to predict at this point in time. As commodities have firmed up, so we find increase in
the steel cost because the demand from steel buyers is significantly higher at this point in time.
But it is under negotiation. We find that the precious metals, which had gone up immediately
after the war, have kind of settled down. But there are concerns largely on steel and some other
commodities like aluminium, copper etc. So, it is difficult to give you a guidance at this point in
time. We are waiting and watching and it will also depend on how demand and supply pans out
in the near future.
