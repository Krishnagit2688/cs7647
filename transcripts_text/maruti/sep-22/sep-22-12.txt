MSIL Conference Call Transcript 28th October 2022Chirag Shah: Sir, one very specific question on the SUV strategy. are you looking to enter the compact car
category because some of your peers for example Tata Punch are trying to address that category
with a SUV type or SUV feel model. is there a part of your strategy the SUV launches that you’re
indicating? And if you can elaborate on it, it would be helpful.
Rahul Bharti: Sorry, you mentioned SUV or XEV?
Chirag Shah: SUV type of a product like Tata Punch, is a compact SUV, addressing that Baleno kind of a
range in terms of price point.
Rahul Bharti: So, as Mr. Seth mentioned some time ago, let’s keep the excitement and let’s bring our products
which deliver pleasant surprises to the customers. So, you’ll have to wait for sometime.
Chirag Shah: And sir, second questions was on the strong hybrid, is there any restriction or technological
limitation on the size of the vehicle to add strong hybrids? How much lower you can go in terms
of technology today, in terms of price of the vehicle?
Rahul Bharti: So, you are right. Strong hybrids at the moment we have solutions in slightly bigger cars which
have room and the engine room to accommodate both the powetrains. It becomes a bit of a
challenge to bring them in smaller cars. But that is what Suzuki’s competence is all about. So,
we’ll watch the market and to reduce carbon we have to adopt a portfolio of technologies and
each technology, each model will have its own context, its cost, its volume. So, it’s a complex
equation that we keep working on all the time. we’ll keep watching how we can maximize hybrid
volumes in the future.
