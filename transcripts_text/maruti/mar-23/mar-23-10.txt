: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chandramouli Muthiah from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chandramouli Muthiah: My first question is on the Grand Vitara model. I think the strong hybrid variant mix seems now be the mid 20%
based on your last update versus in excess of 40% at the time of the launch last year. So, could you just share
your thoughts on what could be driving this normalization? And any thoughts you are able to share around the
Company’s plans for strong hybrid technology for the other utility vehicles in the portfolio would also be helpful.
Rahul Bharti: See this is a very normal phenomenon across, it’s not just to do with the powertrain. Whenever we launch a new
model, the first few sales have a higher percentage of the topmost variant or the topmost features or functionality
and then it normalizes after that, because the early adopters you know, they take the bookings first. So, it’s a very
normal phenomenon across features, not just the powertrain. You are right, it’s in the mid-20s and the people
who drive this car or drive this strong hybrid technology are very happy with it, we have got a positive response.
We plan to bring in more models also, as you mentioned.
Chandramouli Muthiah: My second question is on the channel inventory numbers, as things stand maybe if you could just share your
channel inventory numbers for the domestic market, export market, factory inventory and sort of discount per
vehicle as well, please.
Rahul Bharti: Inventory is below normal, it’s about two to three weeks. We would have liked it to be higher.
Chandramouli Muthiah: And just the discount per vehicle as well at the end of the quarter.
Ajay Seth: Mentioned it earlier for the quarter it is at INR 13,269 per vehicle.
