: The next question is from the line of Nitij Mangal from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Nitij Mangal: You mentioned that when you're thinking of price hikes, there are limitations, and you have to
calibrate the expense. I just want to understand what are you more worried about, is it demand
or is it competition and market shares and Secondly, if it's more on the demand side with the
kind of recovery we have seen both after the first and the second wave, would there be a case to
accelerate price hikes to recoup margins?
Shashank Srivastava: You are right, actually, if you were to choose between the demand side worry or the market
share, of course, demand is something which we are not entirely sure of going forward because
of the doubts about the third wave and so on and so forth, but of course the market share is a
consequence of those volumes. So, in that sense there is a connection between both the volumes
which we are targeting as well as the market share. Is that okay or you want some more
elaboration?

MSIL conference call transcript, 28th July, 2021Nitij Mangal: Actually, maybe just add a little bit that with the kind of recovery we have seen and even after
second wave as a Company are you more confident of taking price hikes versus maybe start of
the year or how are you thinking about that?
Shashank Srivastava: Surely, of course, the quick bounce back and I must say the bounce back has been better than
expected especially in the urban areas I mentioned earlier. While we look at it as a single entity,
the price hike and the demand actually we have to break it down into segments. As you know,
different segments have different price elasticity. So, we have to make estimate not just of an
overall hike but also specific to the segments where the demand is coming from. So, we have to
take into account all that and as Seth san very rightly mentioned we then take a calibrated call
depending on those segments and the elasticity.
