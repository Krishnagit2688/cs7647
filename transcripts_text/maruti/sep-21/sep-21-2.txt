Company is also facilitating its value chain partners and business associates in this regard. The
Company will continue to observe all COVID-19 SOPs and precautions, be sensitive to the
human and social element, build an environment of positivity and keep working hard as its bit
in these difficult times.
Coming to the business performance, Q2 FY 21-22 was a challenging quarter because of
unprecedented global supply crisis of electronic components. As a result, the Company
witnessed a significant disruption in its production operations. An estimated 116,000 vehicles
could not be produced owing to the electronics component shortage mostly corresponding to the
domestic models.
Coming to the demand environment, post the disruptions caused by 2nd wave of COVID in Q1
FY21-22, the demand started to recover. The enquiry, bookings and retails in Q2 FY21-22 has
shown an improvement, however lack of vehicles because of electronic component shortages
has impacted the whole-sale volumes. The Company had more than 200,000 pending customer
orders at the end of the quarter for which the Company is making all efforts to expedite
deliveries.
In Q2 FY21-22, the sales in rural market improved in comparison to the urban markets, as a
result the penetration of overall sales in the rural markets increased to over 43% in Q2 FY21-22.
The customer acceptance towards CNG vehicles have increased and in Q2FY 21-22 the
penetration of sales from CNG vehicles in overall sales stands at 17.8% up from 11.2% in the
same period previous year.
This quarter was also marked by an unprecedented increase in the prices of commodities like
steel, aluminium and precious metals within a span of one year. The Company made maximum
efforts to absorb input cost increases offsetting them through cost reduction and passed on
minimum impact to customers by way of car price increase.
