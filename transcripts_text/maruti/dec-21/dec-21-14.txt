: The next question is from the line of Nitij Mangal from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Nitij Mangal: What are the plans for capacity expansion at Gujarat, what will make you comfortable or
confident to go for the next rounds?
Rahul Bharti: In Gujarat, the third line is already operational and we have the option of two shifts also. So with
that, our total capacity is 2.2 million per annum. And a little bit of productivity stretch is always
possible.
Nitij Mangal: I was just thinking so let's say to start the next line today, it will probably take another two, two
and a half years. So let's say in the next few years when do you think you'll have to start that
expansion?
Rahul Bharti: This is where our productivity stretch helps always and in the past also, whenever marketing has
required, production has always risen to the occasion and they have been able to deliver. And
this stretch also improves our operational leverage and our profitability. So we keep doing that
all the time across cycles.
Nitij Mangal: My second question is on exports. We have seen a very good decent volumes over there. Last

potential in those markets?
Rahul Bharti: I mentioned about the three-pronged strategy, more number of products, more markets and more
density of the network within those markets, so, they have generated good dividends and it is
sustainable at least in the medium-term. We have to keep in mind that global markets do have a
sense of unpredictability and surprises, sometimes some country develops some protectionist
measure, and some economy goes up or comes down. So, we will go along the way and we
would like to keep increasing our exports.
