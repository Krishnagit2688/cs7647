: The next question is from the line of Joseph George from IIFL. Please go ahead.
Joseph George: If you look at the commentary coming in from a lot of companies, such as two wheeler
companies, tractors or recently FMCG companies, there's a buzz that there is a lot of weakness
in the rural markets, and we are seeing that in two wheeler sales, tractor sales etc., So what are
the things that you're seeing in the rural market and historically rural isn't growing faster for you
compared to urban, but if you can update us on trends there especially in the context of what
other companies are saying?
Shashank Srivastava: So, in our case, rural markets still continue to have a strong run. And if you see that, the
percentage of sales in the rural areas actually gone up a little bit in this year. So from around
41%, 41.5% it has just shot up to 43%. So, it does indicate the rural markets are still robust and
going strong. And I think there are reasons for it also which we have been stating. The kharif
crop has been record, you have had good monsoons back-to-back, the rabi sowing this year so
far has been very good, and MSPs have actually gone up. So, we consider that as a good sign
for rural growth to continue. And by the way, tractor industry also if you look at the calendar
year, it has actually grown on the back of record growth last year. We expect the rural to continue
to show strength.
