Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks
Thank you. Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call
to discuss the results for Q1 of FY2024. Joining us today on this call are Sandeep
Batra, Rakesh, Anindya and Abhinek.
The Indian economy continues to be resilient amidst signs of slowdown in the global
economy. The underlying indicators reflect continuing growth in economic activity,
with expansion in manufacturing and services PMI, higher tax collections, real estate
buoyancy and resilient urban demand. The Government led capex cycle is
continuing. Though there has been a pause in the monetary tightening cycle in India,
the global and domestic inflation, liquidity and rate environment continues to evolve.
At ICICI Bank, our strategic focus continues to be on growing our core operating
profit less provisions, i.e., profit before tax excluding treasury gains through the 360-
degree customer centric approach and by serving opportunities across ecosystems
and micro markets. We continue to operate within our strategic framework and
strengthen our franchise, enhance our delivery and servicing capabilities and expand
our technology and digital offerings.
2The core operating profit less provisions grew by 38.0% year-on-year to 125.95
billion Rupees in this quarter. The core operating profit increased by 35.2% year-on-
year to 138.87 billion Rupees in this quarter. The profit after tax grew by 39.7% year-
on-year to 96.48 billion Rupees in this quarter.
Total deposits grew by 17.9% year-on-year and 4.9% sequentially at June 30, 2023.
Term deposits increased by 25.8% year-on-year and 9.8% sequentially at June 30,
2023. During the quarter, the average current and savings account deposits grew
by 6.6% year-on-year and 2.6% sequentially. The Bank’s liquidity coverage ratio for
the quarter was about 124%.
The domestic loan portfolio grew by 20.6% year-on-year and 4.0% sequentially at
June 30, 2023. The retail loan portfolio grew by 21.9% year-on-year and 4.5%
sequentially. Including non-fund based outstanding, the retail portfolio was 45.9%
of the total portfolio. The business banking portfolio grew by 30.4% year-on-year
and 3.8% sequentially. The SME portfolio grew by 28.5% year-on-year and 5.0%
sequentially. The rural portfolio grew by 17.6% year-on-year and 3.6% sequentially.
The domestic corporate portfolio grew by 19.3% year-on-year and 2.8% sequentially
driven by growth across well-rated financial and non-financial corporates. The
overall loan portfolio including the international branches portfolio grew by 18.1%
year-on-year and 3.7% sequentially at June 30, 2023.
We continue to enhance our digital offerings and platforms to onboard new
customers in a seamless manner, provide them end-to-end digital journeys and
personalized solutions, and enable more effective data driven cross sell and up sell.
We have shared some details on our technology and digital offerings in slides 15 to
26 of the investor presentation.
3The net NPA ratio was 0.48% at June 30, 2023, compared to 0.48% at March 31,
2023 and 0.70% at June 30, 2022. During the quarter, there were net additions of
18.07 billion Rupees to gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, reflecting mainly
the seasonal higher additions in the kisan credit card portfolio and lower recoveries
and upgrades from the corporate portfolio compared to the last couple of quarters.
The total provisions during the quarter were 12.92 billion Rupees or 9.3% of core
operating profit and 0.49% of average advances. The provisioning coverage ratio on
NPAs was 82.4% at June 30, 2023. In addition, the Bank continues to hold
contingency provisions of 131.00 billion Rupees or about 1.2% of total loans as of
June 30, 2023.
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 16.66%,
Tier 1 ratio of 16.76% and total capital adequacy ratio of 17.47% at June 30, 2023,
including profits for Q1 of 2024.
Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to drive risk calibrated profitable growth.
We believe our focus on customer 360, extensive franchise and collaboration within
the organisation, backed by our digital offerings and process improvement and
service delivery initiatives will enable us to deliver holistic solutions to customers in
a seamless manner and grow market share across key segments. We will continue
to make investments in technology, people, distribution and building our brand. We
will remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with prudent provisioning
and healthy levels of capital. The principles of “Return of Capital”, “Fair to Customer,
Fair to Bank” and “One Bank, One Team, One RoE” will continue to guide our
operations. We remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable returns to
our shareholders.
I now hand the call over to Anindya.

the overall loan book at June 30, 2023. The non-India linked corporate portfolio

overseas corporate portfolio, about 90% comprises Indian corporates, 6% is
overseas corporates with Indian linkage, 2% comprises companies owned by NRIs
or PIOs and balance 2% is non-India corporates.
B. Credit quality
There were net additions of 18.07 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the current quarter
compared to 0.14 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The net additions to gross
NPAs were 19.32 billion Rupees in the retail, rural and business banking portfolios
and there were net deletions of gross NPAs of 1.25 billion Rupees in the corporate
and SME portfolio.
5The gross NPA additions were 53.18 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared
to 42.97 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. Recoveries and upgrades from gross
NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 35.11 billion Rupees in the current quarter
compared to 42.83 billion Rupees in the previous quarter.
The gross NPA additions from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio were
50.72 billion Rupees compared to 40.20 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There
were gross NPA additions of about 6.66 billion Rupees from the kisan credit card
portfolio in the current quarter. We typically see higher NPA additions from the kisan
credit card portfolio in the first and third quarter of a fiscal year. Recoveries and
upgrades from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio were 31.40 billion
Rupees compared to 31.47 billion Rupees in the previous quarter.
The gross NPA additions from the corporate and SME portfolio were 2.46 billion
Rupees compared to 2.77 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. Recoveries and
upgrades from the corporate and SME portfolio were 3.71 billion Rupees compared
to 11.36 billion Rupees in the previous quarter.
The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 11.69 billion Rupees. There was
no sale of NPAs in the current quarter compared to sale of 2.01 billion Rupees for
cash in the previous quarter.
The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was
37.04 billion Rupees as of June 30, 2023 compared to 37.80 billion Rupees as of
March 31, 2023. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 19.64 billion Rupees
against this non-fund based outstanding.
6The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers under resolution as per
various guidelines declined to 39.46 billion Rupees or about 0.4% of the total loan
portfolio at June 30, 2023 from 45.08 billion Rupees as of March 31, 2023. Of the
total fund based outstanding under resolution at June 30, 2023, 34.06 billion Rupees
was from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 5.40 billion Rupees was
from the corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 12.24 billion
Rupees against these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI
guidelines.
Moving on to the P&L details:
C. P&L details
Net interest income increased by 38.0% year-on-year to 182.27 billion Rupees. The
net interest margin was 4.78% in this quarter compared to 4.90% in the previous
quarter and 4.01% in Q1 of last year. The sequential movement in NIM reflects the
lagged impact of increase in deposit rates over the last year on cost of deposits,
offset, in part, by an increase in loan and investment yields. Of the total domestic
loans, interest rates on 46% are linked to the repo rate, 3% to other external
benchmarks and 20% to MCLR and other older benchmarks. The balance 31% of
loans have fixed interest rates. The impact of interest on income tax refund on net
interest margin was 3 basis points in Q1 of this year compared to nil in the previous
quarter and 3 basis points in Q1 of last year.
The domestic NIM was at 4.88% this quarter compared to 5.02% in the previous
quarter and 4.14% in Q1 of last year. The cost of deposits was 4.31% in this quarter
compared to 3.98% in the previous quarter, reflecting the increase in deposit rates
over the last year, though rates on incremental retail term deposits have largely
7stabilized and wholesale deposit rates have moderated. We expect the cost of
deposits to continue to increase over the next couple of quarters.
Non-interest income, excluding treasury gains, grew by 12.0% year-on-year to 51.83
billion Rupees in Q1 of 2024
 Fee income increased by 14.1% year-on-year to 48.43 billion Rupees in this
quarter. Fees from retail, rural, business banking and SME customers constituted
about 78% of the total fees in this quarter.
 Dividend income from subsidiaries and associates was 2.91 billion Rupees in this
quarter compared to 3.47 billion Rupees in Q1 of last year. The year-on-year
decline in dividend income was due to lower final dividend from ICICI Securities
Primary Dealership.
On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 25.9% year-on-year in this
quarter. Employee expenses increased by 36.3% year-on-year in this quarter
reflecting the annual increments, promotions and increase in number of employees
over the last 12 months. The Bank had about 135,000 employees at June 30, 2023.
The number of employees has increased by about 27,650 in the last 12 months. Non-
employee expenses increased by 19.5% year-on-year in this quarter primarily due to
retail business related expenses and technology expenses. Our branch count has
increased by 174 in the first quarter and we had 6,074 branches as of June 30, 2023.
The technology expenses were about 9.0% of our operating expenses in this quarter.
The core operating profit increased by 35.2% year-on-year to 138.87 billion Rupees
in this quarter. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries and associates, the core
operating profit grew by 37.0% year-on-year.
8The total provisions during the quarter were 12.92 billion Rupees, or 9.3% of core
operating profit and 0.49% of average advances, including the seasonal impact of
kisan credit card NPAs and lower write-back from corporate recoveries and
upgrades relative to the last couple of quarters. The provisioning coverage on NPAs
was 82.4% as of June 30, 2023. In addition, we hold 12.24 billion Rupees of
provisions on borrowers under resolution. Further, the Bank continues to hold
contingency provision of 131.00 billion Rupees as of June 30, 2023. At the end of
June, the total provisions, other than specific provisions on fund-based outstanding
to borrowers classified as non-performing, were 223.46 billion Rupees or 2.1% of
loans.
The core operating profit less provisions grew by 38.0% year-on-year to 125.95
billion Rupees in Q1 of this year.
There was a treasury gain of 2.52 billion Rupees in Q1 compared to a gain of 0.36
billion Rupees in Q1 of the previous year, primarily reflecting proprietary trading
gains capitalising on market opportunities during the quarter.
The tax expense was 31.99 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 22.60 billion
Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit after tax grew by 39.7%
year-on-year to 96.48 billion Rupees in this quarter.
Sandeep earlier talked about the capital adequacy position with a CET-1 ratio,
including profits for Q1 of 2024, of 16.66%, Tier 1 ratio of 16.76% and total capital
adequacy ratio of 17.47% at June 30, 2023. These ratios include the impact of
increase in risk-weighted assets for operational risk, which is computed in first
quarter of every fiscal year. Also during this quarter, there was a redemption of Tier
1 bonds of 40.00 billion Rupees.
9D. Growth in digital offerings

of growing the risk-calibrated core operating profit. We continue to see increasing
adoption and usage of our digital platforms by our customers.

account holders at end-June 2023. We have seen about 230,000 registrations by
non-ICICI Bank account holders on InstaBIZ till June 30, 2023. Our merchant STACK
offers an array of banking and value-added services to retailers, online businesses
and large e-commerce firms such as digital current account opening, instant

purpose-based digital solutions to corporate clients and their ecosystems. Our Trade
