The next question is from the line of Sharaj from Laburnum Capital. Please go ahead
Shahraj:
My question is on the contingent provision that you made. So, is there some specific
segment of the book we are providing for against in times of crisis?
Page 15 of 22Anindya Banerjee:
No. We look across the portfolio. It's quite a broad range of portfolios that we look at.
Shahraj:
I was particularly asking from the SME and business banking segment. Would it be fair to
expect this would be hit hard if there was a slowdown?
Anindya Banerjee:
Actually, that segment has behaved quite well for us. In fact, I would say that even if we
look at the analysis that we had done at the start of the pandemic when the moratorium
was on, this is one of the segments where the outcomes have probably been a little bit
overall in line or better. But of course, in an environment of a lot of macro volatility, this
could be a segment that will see some vulnerability. But as far as the contingent provisions
are concerned, we are looking at a fairly broad range of portfolio.
Shahraj:
Thank you so much, sir. Congratulations on the results and Happy Diwali.
Anindya Banerjee:
Thank you. Happy Diwali.
