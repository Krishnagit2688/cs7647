The next question is from the line of MB Mahesh from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.
MB Mahesh:
Just 2 questions from my side. First one on the deposit side again. When you look at these
CASA balances especially on the SA side and you look at the salaried accounts, from a
broad perspective has the average salary at the retail level gone up? If yes, when you look
at the numbers, how much would that number look like? Just a ballpark number to
understand how much of this interest rate hike can be offset by higher incomes that the
consumer is seeing today?
Anindya Banerjee:
We have not really given such an analysis, Mahesh, so I would not be able to give you any
comment.
MB Mahesh:
I mean the direction mostly, not so much about specific numbers at least.
Rakesh Jha:
We have not given any data like that. But as you know, there's a lot of data which has come
out saying that the average salary increase has been in the region of 10% or so. So, that
will be reflected for everyone in general.
MB Mahesh:
Page 21 of 22So, you would say that the number, which is floating around in the public domain, broadly
reflects what you're seeing as well or you wouldn't have done that analysis as well?
Rakesh Jha:
Yes, because that is the actual data which is there, so it will reflect
MB Mahesh:
So, just another question. This One Bank, One ROE target that one has been for 3 to 4
years. How has been the attrition level at the bank? Has it gone up, gone down? If you
could just kind of broadly comment about it.
Anindya Banerjee:
So, attrition rates in the financial sector over the last 12 to 18 months for all entities,
whatever the approach to performance management they may follow, has gone up
substantially and I don't think there is anything idiosyncratic with us.
