The next question is from the line of Jignesh from Incred Capital. Please go ahead
Page 17 of 22Jignesh:
I wanted to discuss similar to what Krishnan was asking earlier. In this interest rate cycle
side, can we assume that at least incrementally on the new loans not on the existing loans,
which is repo-linked or these treasury-linked loans and all, considering that demand
scenario becomes little fragile, in that case, can we take a hit on the spreads just to manage
the demand? Is that kind of scenario also likely or the spread generally remains stretched
all the time?
Anindya Banerjee:
That's a function of how the market sort of prices the loans. As we said, it is a competitive
market, so it's a decision of each lender based on their strategy and their funding costs as
to what spread over the benchmark they offer on incremental loans. If we look at what has
happened so far in terms of incremental lending, the pass-through would not have been
uniform for all sort of segments of the market and we have to see how that goes along.
Jignesh:
Understood. But there is no regulation as such, right, which restricts you to cut down on
your spreads? That is what I'm trying to understand. So, intermittently if you want to
reduce the spread, that is possible.
Anindya Banerjee:
If I want, yes.
