intended to qualify for the 'safe harbor' under applicable securities laws including the US
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve
a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from

conditions, political or economic instability in the jurisdictions where we have operations,
increase in non-performing loans, unanticipated changes in interest rates, foreign

business, the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, the actual growth in demand
for banking products and services, investment income, cash flow projections, our
exposure to market risks, changes in India’s sovereign rating, and the impact of the Covid-
19 pandemic which could result in fewer business opportunities, lower revenues, and an
increase in the levels of non-performing assets and provisions, depending inter alia upon
the period of time for which the pandemic extends, the remedial measures adopted by
governments and central banks, and the time taken for economic activity to resume at
normal levels after the pandemic, as well as other risks detailed in the reports filed by us
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking
