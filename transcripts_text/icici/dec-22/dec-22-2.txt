Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q3 of FY2023. Joining us today on this call are Anup, Sandeep Batra, Rakesh,
Anindya and Abhinek.
Amid the global uncertainties, India’s GDP growth has been resilient. The pickup in
economic activity is reflected in the expanding purchasing managers’ indices, GST
collections and other high frequency indicators. Financial stability has been maintained
and inflation, though elevated, has moderated from its peak. We will continue to monitor
these developments closely
At ICICI Bank, we aim to grow the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
a 360-degree customer-centric approach and by focusing on ecosystems and micro-
markets. We continue to operate within our strategic framework and strengthen our
franchise, enhance our delivery and servicing capabilities and expand our technology and
digital offerings.
Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:
First- Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through the
focused pursuit of target market segments
The core operating profit increased by 31.6% year-on-year to 132.35 billion Rupees in this
quarter. The profit after tax grew by 34.2% year-on-year to 83.12 billion Rupees in this
quarter.
Second- Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Total period-end deposits grew by 10.3% year-on-year and 2.9% sequentially at
December 31, 2022. Period-end term deposits grew by 14.2% year-on-year and 5.3%
sequentially at December 31, 2022. During the quarter, the average CASA grew by 10.4%
year-on-year and 2% sequentially. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was about
123%.
Page 2 of 19Third- Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward
The retail loan portfolio grew by 23.4% year-on-year and 4.5% sequentially at December
31, 2022. Including non-fund based outstanding, the retail portfolio was 44.9% of the total
portfolio. The business-banking portfolio grew by 37.9% year-on-year and 5.2%
sequentially. The SME portfolio grew by 25% year-on-year and 8.3% sequentially. The
growth in SME and business banking portfolios was driven by leveraging our branch
network and digital offerings such as InstaBIZ and Merchant Stack. The domestic
corporate portfolio grew by 18.2% year-on-year and 4.7% sequentially at December 31,
2022 driven by growth across well-rated financial and non-financial corporates. The rural
portfolio grew by 12.5% year-on-year and 3.8% sequentially. The domestic loan portfolio
grew by 21.4% year-on-year and 4.2% sequentially. The overall loan portfolio grew by
19.7% year-on-year and 3.8% sequentially at December 31, 2022.
Fourth-Leveraging digital across our business
We continue to enhance our digital offerings and platforms to onboard new customers in
a seamless manner and provide them end-to-end digital journeys and personalised
solutions. These platforms also enable us to do cross sell and up sell. We have shared
some details on our technology and digital offerings in slides 17 to 28 of the investor
presentation.
Fifth - Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
The net NPA ratio declined to 0.55% at December 31, 2022 from 0.61% at September 30,
2022 and 0.85% at December 31, 2021. During the quarter, there were net additions of
11.19 billion Rupees to gross NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale. The provisioning
coverage ratio on NPAs was 82% at December 31, 2022. The total provisions during the
quarter were 22.57 billion Rupees or 17.1% of core operating profit and 0.93% of average
advances. This includes contingency provision of 15 billion Rupees made on a prudent
basis. The Bank holds contingency provisions of 115 billion Rupees or about 1.2% of total
loans as of December 31, 2022.
As we have mentioned during the previous earnings calls, we aim to be proactive in
provisioning with a key objective of strengthening our balance sheet. During the quarter,
we have changed our provisioning norms on non-performing assets to make them more
conservative for corporate, SME and business banking. This change resulted in higher
provisions amounting to about 11.96 billion Rupees in Q3-2023.
Page 3 of 19Sixth- Maintaining a strong capital base
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.09%, Tier
1 ratio of 17.58% and total capital adequacy ratio of 18.33% at December 31, 2022,
including profits for 9 months 2023.
Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on growing the core operating profit in a risk-
calibrated manner. We will work as one team by facilitating cross-functional collaboration
to tap into key customer and market segments, enabling 360-degree coverage and
increase in wallet share. We will continue to make investments in technology, people,
distribution and building our brand. The principles of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank” and
“One Bank, One Team, One RoE” will guide our operations. We focus on building a culture
where every employee in the Bank serves customers with humility and upholds the values
of the brand ICICI. We aim to be the trusted financial services provider of choice for our
customers and deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders.
I now hand the call over to Anindya.
Anindya’s opening remarks
Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details,
growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.
A. Balance Sheet growth
Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Coming to the growth across
retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 19.1% year-on-year and 4% sequentially.

and equipment portfolio grew by 3.4% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially. Growth in the
personal loan and credit card portfolio was 44.8% year-on-year and 7.2% sequentially.
This portfolio was 1,154.78 billion Rupees or 11.9% of the overall loan book at December
31, 2022.
The overseas loan portfolio, in US dollar terms, declined by 22.1% year-on-year and 8.7%
sequentially at December 31, 2022. The decline in the overseas book primarily reflects
maturities of the short-term India-linked trade book. The overseas loan portfolio was
about 3.6% of the overall loan book at December 31, 2022. The non-India linked corporate
portfolio declined by 42.8% or about 285 million US dollars on a year-on-year basis. Of the
overseas corporate portfolio, about 86% comprises Indian corporates, 8% is overseas
corporates with Indian linkage, 3% comprises companies owned by NRIs or PIOs and
balance 3% is non-India corporates.
Page 4 of 19On the liabilities side, Sandeep covered the growth in deposits. During the quarter, we
raised long-term infrastructure bonds as well as refinance borrowings from domestic
financial institutions. Overseas borrowings declined reflecting the reduction in assets. We
also had bond maturities arising out of older capital instruments during the quarter.

There were net additions of 11.19 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the current quarter
compared to 6.05 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. The net additions to gross NPAs

and business banking portfolio were 41.59 billion Rupees and from the corporate and SME
portfolio were 15.64 billion Rupees. There were gross NPA additions of about 6.72 billion
Rupees from the Kisan Credit Card portfolio in the current quarter. We typically see higher

The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 38.69
billion Rupees as of December 31, 2022 compared to 35.16 billion Rupees as of September
30, 2022. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 19.93 billion Rupees as of December

Page 5 of 19The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers under resolution as per various

C. P&L Details
Net interest income increased by 34.6% year-on-year to 164.65 billion Rupees. The net
interest margin was 4.65% in this quarter compared to 4.31% in the previous quarter and

45% are linked to the repo rate, 4% to other external benchmarks and 21% to MCLR and
other older benchmarks. The balance 30% of loans have fixed interest rates. The
sequential increase in NIM reflects the impact of increase in interest rates on loan yields
while repricing of deposits occurs with a lag. We expect to see the impact of repricing of
deposits in future quarters.

and usage of our digital platforms by our customers.

billion Rupees at September 30, 2022 and 118.42 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2021.
The sequential decline was primarily due to slippage of borrowers that were under
resolution into NPA and a few repayments during the quarter. The amount of 55.81 billion
Rupees at December 31, 2022 includes 8.79 billion Rupees of outstanding to borrowers
under resolution.
The maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 5

in the outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was mainly due to disbursements to entities having
longer vintage and entities owned by well-established corporate groups.
