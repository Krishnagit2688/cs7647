Sandeep Bakhshi:
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q4 of FY2021. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra,
Rakesh and Anindya.
Thank you all for joining us today. We hope that you are safe and in good health.
The level of economic activity saw an increasing trend from January to March. The Ultra
Frequency Index, comprising several high frequency indicators tracked by our Bank’s
Economic Research Group rose from 106.3 in mid-January to 108.2 in March, indicating
activity sustaining above pre-Covid levels. This was on the back of robust industrial
activity indicators such as power demand, GST collections, rail freight revenues, e-way
bill generation and higher vehicle registrations. Property registrations also continued to
increase during the quarter. However, the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks
has led to the re-imposition of restrictions in various states and cities which has impacted
mobility indicators and economic activity. This is visible in the tapering-off of the Ultra
Frequency index which has fallen to 92.3 in the week of April 18th. Going forward,
economic activity will depend on the trajectory of the second wave of Covid-19, the
progress of the vaccination programme, the intensity of restrictions on movement and
the period for which they continue. We would like to thank the medical and health
workers’ fraternity for their tireless effort in this fight against Covid-19. We express
gratitude to our colleagues who continue to serve our customers despite the challenging
environment.
At ICICI Bank, we have continued to steadily grow our business and franchise, while
maintaining and enhancing the strength of our balance sheet.
1. Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
the focused pursuit of target market segments
Our aim is to achieve risk-calibrated growth in core operating profit through a 360-degree
customer centric approach, tapping opportunities across ecosystems, leveraging
Page 2 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
internal synergies, building partnerships and decongesting processes. The core
operating profit increased by 19.8% year-on-year to 85.65 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021.
This is after an estimated impact of 1.75 billion Rupees of the required refund of interest
on interest and related amounts charged during the moratorium period, which has been
reduced from the interest income. For FY2021, the core operating profit grew by 16.9%
year-on-year to 313.51 billion Rupees. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries,
core operating profit grew by 17.9% year-on-year in FY2021. The profit after tax was
44.03 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021 compared to 12.21 billion Rupees in Q4 last year. For
the full year, profit after tax was 161.93 billion Rupees compared to 79.31 billion Rupees
in FY2020. In line with applicable guidelines, the Board has recommended a dividend of
2 Rupees per share for FY2021 subject to requisite approvals.
2. Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Deposit growth continued to be robust, with total deposits growing at 21.0% year-on-
year at March 31, 2021. During the quarter, average current account deposits increased
by 33.9% year-on-year and average savings account deposits by 21.2% year-on-year.
For FY2021, the growth in average current account deposits was 25.5% year-on-year
and the growth in average savings account deposits was 16.7% year-on-year. Term
deposits grew by 18.4% year-on-year to 5.0 trillion Rupees at March 31, 2021. The
liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was 138%, reflecting continued significant surplus
liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among the lowest in the system. We have
focused on tapping into various ecosystems like payments, merchants and corporate
ecosystems including the employees, startups, dealers and vendors. Our digital offerings
and platforms and efforts towards process decongestion have played an important role
in the growth of our deposit franchise.
3. Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward
Mortgage disbursements continued to increase this quarter over the previous quarter
driven by our efforts to offer a convenient and frictionless experience to customers by
Page 3 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
digitising the entire underwriting process, with instant loan approvals. Disbursements of
commercial vehicles and equipment loans also increased further in Q4 over Q3. The
growth in business banking continued to be robust as we continued to leverage our
distribution network and our digital platforms such as InstaBIZ and Trade Online. Till
April 19, 2021 we have disbursed about 127 billion Rupees under the ECLGS 1.0 scheme
and about 15 billion Rupees has been disbursed under the ECLGS 2.0 scheme. Credit
card spends increased substantially in Q4 of 2021 over the previous quarter driven by
spends across electronics, wellness and jewellery categories. The total Amazon Pay
credit cards at March 31, 2021 are about 1.6 million. The growth in the rural portfolio
was driven by jewel loans. The retail loan portfolio grew by 19.9% year-on-year and
6.6% sequentially. The growth of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was
13.2% year-on-year and 4.7% sequentially. Overall, the domestic loan portfolio grew by
17.7% year-on-year and 6.1% sequentially. The overseas branches portfolio and within
that, the non-India linked corporate portfolio, declined both sequentially and year-on-
year, in line with the approach which we have articulated earlier.
4. Leveraging digital across our business
Our micromarket strategy to tap opportunities based on the market potential and 360-
degree customer coverage using ICICI STACK have played a significant role in expanding
our franchise and deepening relationships with our customers. We continue to
strengthen our position in the digital payments ecosystem by building seamless user
journeys, facilitating higher transaction throughputs and driving repeat transactions. Our
strategy is to participate both directly through our own platforms and partner with third
party players in the P2P and P2M space of the UPI ecosystem. We look at this
transformation in payments as an opportunity to derive rich data from transactions. In
December 2020, we had expanded our state-of-the-art mobile banking app, iMobile, to
iMobile Pay which offers payment and banking services to customers of any bank. We
have seen over 1.5 million activations of iMobile Pay from non-ICICI Bank customers
within four months of its launch. We are seeing high customer engagement through
repeat usage of features like Pay2Contact, Scan to Pay and bill payments among others.
We have also invested in the merchant ecosystem over the last few quarters and put
together a best-in-class payments stack. The monthly transaction value on our merchant
Page 4 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
acquisition platform, Eazypay, has increased four times in March 2021 over June 2020.
We have further strengthened our API stack to ensure that our customers are given best
in class payment solutions. This has led to greater fund flows, growth in CASA deposits
and cross-sell opportunities.
With our robust digital platforms and strong partnerships, we will continue to enhance
our capabilities to compete. We are building a vast data lake to derive insights into
customer behaviour, build new use cases to improve our product penetration, increase
customer stickiness and improve our net promoter scores. We are also investing in new
journeys and innovating existing journeys for higher value transactions through NEFT
and RTGS which remain at the core of high value financial transactions.
5. Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
The gross NPA additions, excluding borrowers in the proforma NPAs as of December
31, 2020, were 55.23 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021. The proforma NPAs have also been
appropriately classified as per the RBI guidelines issued following the final judgement of
the Supreme Court. For the full year FY2021, the gross additions to NPA were 161.23
billion Rupees, or about 2.2% of opening customer assets. In addition, excluding NPAs,
the total fund based outstanding to all borrowers, including MSME borrowers, under
resolution as per various guidelines that are in place, was 39.27 billion Rupees or about
0.5% of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2021.These are in line with or better than
our expectations of NPA additions and loans under resolution.
At December 31, 2020, the Bank held aggregate Covid-19 provisions of 99.84 billion
Rupees including contingency provisions of 35.09 billion Rupees for proforma NPAs.
During the quarter, the Bank utilized the contingency provision of 35.09 billion Rupees
held against proforma NPAs, as these loans have now been classified as per the RBI
guidelines. The provisioning coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 77.7% as of
March 31, 2021. Further, the Bank has made additional Covid-19 related provision of
10.00 billion Rupees, and thus at March 31, 2021, the outstanding Covid-19 related
provisions were 74.75 billion Rupees.
Page 5 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
The performance of the portfolio in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated the
robustness of our underwriting and portfolio selection in recent years. Even after taking
into account the higher NPA additions due to the pandemic, we have maintained a
healthy provisioning coverage, including by making our provisioning policy more
conservative. Further, we continue to hold Covid-19 related provisions of 74.75 billion
Rupees. While the formation of gross non-performing assets in FY2022 will depend on
the trajectory of the second wave of Covid-19, the progress of the vaccination
programme and the pandemic-related restrictions and the period for which they
continue, the portfolio performance in FY2021 and the strength of the balance sheet give
us significant comfort.
6. Maintaining a strong capital base
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 16.80% at
March 31, 2021. Further, the market value of the Bank’s investments in listed subsidiaries
is about 812 billion Rupees.
Looking ahead, we see many opportunities in the medium term to grow the core
operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner. We will calibrate our growth in the near term
based on the operating environment and conditions resulting from the second wave of
the Covid-19 pandemic. We have a wide physical distribution network and our best-in-
class digital platforms provide seamless onboarding and transacting experience for our
customers. We continue to innovate, invest in technology and drive analytics to get
deeper insights into customer behavior. Our solutions are aligned to provide the full
range of banking services and capture the opportunities concentrated around economic
ecosystems. Our extensive franchise, focus on digitisation and seamless delivery of
products and services to customers with 360-degree coverage and strong balance sheet
offer us immense opportunities to grow in a risk calibrated manner. Our approach of
‘One Bank, One RoE’ with a delayered organization architecture at the leadership level,
over the last two years has helped us to leverage internal synergies. We continue to be
guided by our philosophy of “Fair to Customer, Fair to Bank” emphasising the need to
deliver fair value to customers while creating value for shareholders. We will continue to
focus on delivering consistent and predictable returns to our shareholders.

A. Balance sheet growth
The overall loan portfolio grew by 13.7% year-on-year at March 31, 2021. The domestic
loan portfolio grew by 17.7% year-on-year and 6.1% sequentially at March 31, 2021. The

The growth of the performing domestic corporate portfolio was 13.2% year-on-year and
4.7% sequentially, driven by disbursements to higher rated corporates and PSUs across
various sectors to meet their working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
The overseas loan portfolio declined by 27.9% year-on-year at March 31, 2021. The
overseas loan portfolio was 5.1% of the overall loan book at March 31, 2021. We had
mentioned in our previous quarter earnings call that we would be progressively exiting
our non-India linked exposures in a planned manner. The non-India linked corporate
portfolio reduced by 56.0% or about 1.6 billion US Dollars year-on-year and 24.0% or
about 391 million US Dollars sequentially, at March 31, 2021.

retail portfolio, excluding borrowers in the proforma NPAs, were 43.55 billion Rupees.
The gross NPA additions from the corporate and SME portfolio, excluding borrowers in
the proforma NPAs, were 11.68 billion Rupees, of which 10.67 billion Rupees was from
the portfolio rated BB and below as of December 31, 2020. The corporate and SME NPA
additions include one account in the construction sector which was rated BB and below
at December 31 and was classified as non-performing during Q4 and upgraded in the
same quarter post the implementation by all lenders of a resolution plan as per RBI’s
framework.
Recoveries and upgrades, excluding recoveries from proforma NPAs as of December
31, 2020, write-offs and sale, were 25.60 billion Rupees in the current quarter. There were
recoveries and upgrades of 8.20 billion Rupees from the retail portfolio and 17.40 billion
Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio. The gross NPAs written-off during the
quarter were 27.45 billion Rupees.
The net non-performing assets were 91.80 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021 compared
to 96.32 billion Rupees on a proforma basis at December 31, 2020. The gross NPA ratio
declined to 4.96% at March 31, 2021 from to 5.42% on a proforma basis at December
31, 2020 and the net NPA ratio declined to 1.14% at March 31, 2021 from 1.26% on a
proforma basis at December 31, 2020. Till the last quarter, we used to report non-fund
outstanding to NPAs as a part of the BB and below portfolio. From this quarter, we are
excluding it from the BB and below portfolio and reporting it separately. The non-fund
Page 8 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 44.05 billion Rupees
as of March 31, 2021 compared to 44.07 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020. The Bank
holds provisions amounting to 14.92 billion Rupees as of March 31, 2021 on this non-
fund based outstanding.
Excluding NPAs, the total fund based outstanding to all borrowers, including MSME
borrowers, under resolution as per various guidelines was about 39.27 billion Rupees or
about 0.5% of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2021. Of the above fund based
outstanding, 20.12 billion Rupees was from the retail loan portfolio. The Bank holds
provisions of 7.16 billion Rupees against these borrowers, which is in excess of the
requirement as per RBI guidelines.
The percentage of performing retail EMI products and the credit card portfolio which
was overdue was marginally higher compared to pre-Covid levels at March 31, 2021 and
about 1.5% higher at December-end and 4% higher at September-end. The percentage
of the performing SME and business banking portfolio which was overdue had reached
pre-covid levels at September-end and continues to remain so at March-end as well. The
percentage of the performing rural portfolio which was overdue at March 31, 2021 was
about 2.5% higher than the normal pre-Covid trend compared to about 1.5% higher at
December-end and 1% higher at September-end. About 2% of the performing domestic
corporate portfolio was overdue at March-end, which was similar compared to
December-end and September-end.
C. P&L Details
Net interest income increased by 16.8% year-on-year to 104.31 billion Rupees. Interest
on income tax refund was 0.11 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 1.96 billion
Rupees in the previous quarter and 0.27 billion Rupees in Q4 of last year. The net interest
margin was at 3.84% in Q4 of 2021 compared to 3.67% in the previous quarter and
3.87% in Q4 of last year. The impact of interest on income tax refund and interest
collections from NPAs was about 4 basis points this quarter compared to about 11 basis
points in the previous quarter and about 4 basis points in Q4 of last year. As per the
judgement of the Supreme Court, an estimated amount of 1.75 billion Rupees of the
required refund of interest on interest and related amounts accrued on loans during the
Page 9 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
moratorium period has been reduced from the interest income in Q4 of 2021. The
domestic NIM was at 3.94% this quarter compared to 3.78% in Q3 and 4.14% in Q4 last
year. International margins were at 0.44%. The cost of deposits was 3.80% in Q4
compared to 3.97% in Q3.
Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 3.1% year-on-year to 41.37
billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021.
 Fee income increased by 6.0% year-on-year to 38.15 billion Rupees in Q4.
Retail fees grew by 9.4% year-on-year and constituted about 77% of the total
fees in Q4-2021.
 Dividend income from subsidiaries was 3.57 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021
compared to 3.38 billion Rupees in Q4 of last year.
On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 3.6% year-on-year in Q4. The
employee expenses decreased by 10.2% year-on-year primarily due to decline in
provisions for retirals reflecting the increase in yields on government securities during
the quarter compared to the decline in yields in Q4 last year. The Bank had 98,750
employees at March 31, 2021. Non-employee expenses increased by 12.3% year-on-
year in Q4 of 2021 due to increase in retail business related costs and technology related
expenses partly offset by decrease in advertisement and sales promotion expenses. For
FY2021, employee expenses decreased by 2.2% year-on-year and non-employee
expenses increased by 0.9% year-on-year. We continue to make investments in
technology and to grow our franchise.
The core operating profit increased by 19.8% year-on-year to 85.65 billion Rupees in Q4
of 2021. For FY2021, the core operating profit grew by 16.9% year-on-year to 313.51
billion Rupees. Excluding dividend income from subsidiaries, core operating profit grew
by 17.9% year-on-year in FY2021.
There was a treasury loss of 0.25 billion Rupees this quarter compared to a profit of 7.66
billion Rupees in Q3. The loss during the quarter reflects the increase in yields on fixed
income and government securities.
Page 10 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
The net provisions during the quarter were 28.83 billion. At December 31, 2020, the Bank
held aggregate Covid-19 provisions of 99.84 billion Rupees including contingency
provisions of 35.09 billion Rupees for proforma NPAs. During the quarter, the Bank
utilized the contingency provision of 35.09 billion Rupees held against proforma NPAs,
as these loans have now been classified as per the RBI guidelines. The provisioning
coverage on NPAs continued to be robust at 77.7% as of March 31, 2021.
Further, the Bank has made additional Covid-19 related provision of 10.00 billion Rupees
and thus at March 31, 2021, the outstanding Covid-19 related provisions were 74.75
billion Rupees. At March 31, 2021, the total outstanding Covid-19 related provisions,
provisions for non-fund based outstanding to NPAs, general provisions on standard
assets and other standard asset provisions were 141.44 billion Rupees or 1.9% of loans.
The total net provisions made during the year were 162.14 billion Rupees. These include
Covid-19 related provision made during the year, net of utilisation during the year, of
47.50 billion Rupees; and additional provisions made reflecting our change in our
provisioning policy, of about 26 billion Rupees. Excluding the same, the provisions were
88.64 billion Rupees or about 1.35% of average advances in FY2021. In our previous
earnings calls, we have mentioned that the normalised credit cost level for our portfolio
would be about 1.2-1.3%. Compared to our expected normalized level of credit costs,
the provisions, excluding Covid-19 related provisions and the impact of change in
provisioning policy, were higher by about 15 basis points or about 10 billion Rupees.
As Sandeep mentioned, the performance of the portfolio in the face of the pandemic has
demonstrated the robustness of our underwriting and portfolio selection in recent years.
We have high provisioning coverage on NPAs and in addition we continue to hold Covid-
19 related provisions of 74.75 billion Rupees, which is about 1% of loans and
substantially higher than the provisions in excess of the normalized level in FY2021. We
are therefore confident of the strength and resilience of our balance sheet.
The profit before tax was 56.57 billion Rupees in Q4 of 2021 compared to 14.23 billion
Rupees in Q4 last year. The tax expense was 12.54 billion in Q4 of 2021 compared to
2.02 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit after tax was 44.03
billion Rupees in Q4 this year compared to 12.21 billion Rupees in Q4 of last year. The
Page 11 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
profit after tax was 161.93 billion Rupees in FY2021 compared to 79.31 billion Rupees in
FY2020.
The consolidated profit after tax was 48.86 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 54.98
billion Rupees in Q3 and 12.51 billion Rupees in Q4 last year. The consolidated profit
after tax was 183.84 billion Rupees in FY2021 compared to 95.66 billion Rupees in
FY2020.
D. Capital
The CET1 ratio, was 16.80% at March 31, 2021 compared to 16.79% at December 31,
2020. The Tier 1 ratio was 18.06% and the total capital adequacy ratio was 19.12% at
March 31, 2021.
E. Portfolio information
We are focused on growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk
and reward. Our retail is built based on proprietary data and analytics in addition to
bureau checks, and well-priced in relation to the risk. Our strong deposit franchise
enables us to offer competitive pricing to the selected customer segments. The portfolio
level build-up strategy for the retail loan book has been based on utilising the existing
customer database for sourcing key retail asset products through cross sell and up-sell.
The loan disbursements across various retail products had increased beyond pre-Covid
levels in Q4 driven by pickup in economic activity and our efforts towards process
decongestions and digitization of underwriting and customer onboarding process. We
had calibrated our sourcing towards stronger profiles immediately after the onset of
Covid-19 last year and are continuing with the same approach. We have also been
cautious in underwriting proposals related to sectors directly impacted by Covid-19. We
are prepared for additional calibrated response in view of the second wave of the Covid-
19 pandemic and are watching the developments closely. We have given further
information on our portfolio in slides 32 to 42 of our investor presentation.
The loan and non-fund based outstanding to corporate and SME borrowers rated BB and
below (excluding fund and non-fund based outstanding to NPAs) was 130.98 billion
Page 12 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
Rupees at March 31, 2021 compared to 136.54 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020,
details of which are given on slide 34 of the investor presentation. Other than two
accounts, one each in construction and telecom sectors, the maximum single borrower
outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at March 31,
2021.
On slide 35 of the presentation, we have provided the movement in our BB and below
portfolio during Q4 of 2021. In Q4 of 2021:
 The rating downgrades from investment grade categories were 11.87 billion
Rupees. The downgrades were largely from the infrastructure sector;
 The upgrades and net decrease in outstanding were 14.97 billion Rupees;
 There was a reduction of 10.67 billion Rupees due to slippage of some borrowers
to the non-performing category; and
 There were upgrades of 8.21 billion Rupees from NPA to below investment grade
categories
Except a few accounts with aggregate outstanding of about 4 billion Rupees, all
corporate and SME borrowers under resolution were rated below investment
grade at March 31, 2021. This mainly includes one lease rental discounting
account and two projects under implementation account in the commercial real
estate sector.
The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans
and working capital loans was 226.71 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021 or 3% of our total
loan portfolio. As mentioned in our previous calls, our portfolio is granular in nature with
the larger exposures being to well-established builders. About 13% of our builder
portfolio at March 31, 2021 was either rated BB and below internally or was classified as
non-performing.
The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 645.09 billion Rupees at March 31, 2021
compared to 576.29 billion Rupees at December 31, 2020. The total outstanding loans to
NBFCs and HFCs were about 7% of our advances at March 31, 2021. The details are
given on slide 41 of the investor presentation. Our exposure is largely to well-rated
entities with PSUs, long vintage, entities owned by banks and well-established corporate
Page 13 of 31ICICI Bank Ltd
April 24, 2021
groups. The sequential increase in the outstanding during the quarter was mainly due to
increase in outstanding to government owned NBFCs. The proportion of the NBFC and
HFC portfolio internally rated BB and below or non-performing is about 1%.
Coming to our overseas portfolio, excluding exposures to financial institutions and retail
lending against deposits, the total corporate fund and non-fund outstanding of overseas
branches, net of cash or bank or insurance backed lending, was 4.14 billion US dollars
at March 31, 2021 compared to 5.20 billion US dollars at December 31, 2020 and 7.48
billion US dollars at March 31, 2020. 70% of the outstanding at March 31, 2021 was to
Indian corporates and their subsidiaries and joint ventures. 16% of the outstanding was
to non-India companies with Indian or India-linked operations and activities. The portfolio
in this segment is well-rated and the Indian operations of these companies are target
customers for the Bank’s deposit and transaction banking franchise, and we would
continue to pursue risk-calibrated opportunities in this segment. 6% of the outstanding
was to companies owned by NRIs or PIOs. 8% of the outstanding was to other non-India
companies which is less than 1% of the total portfolio of the Bank.
F. Subsidiaries
The details of the financial performance of subsidiaries is covered in slides 46-47 and 68-
73 in the investor presentation.
Value of new business of ICICI Life grew by 25.7% year-on-year to 5.91 billion Rupees in
