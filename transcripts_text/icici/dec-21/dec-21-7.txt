The next question is from the line of Jai Mundra from B&K Securities. Please go ahead.
Jai Mundra:
Can you share some more details on your fee income, maybe you can give the bifurcation
of the fee into may be third-party related, liability-related fee, credit card or any other
bifurcation?
Rakesh Jha:
We don't disclose that. What we do disclose is that 76% of the fees is coming from the
retail, business banking and SME segments. Right now, we have not given any further
details per se, but in future maybe we will look at it.
Jai Mundra:
On growth in SME and business banking, we are putting very strong growth there, I just
wanted to check what could be the lending rate here, I mean, even a broad range would
be helpful, what is the range of interest rates for the loans originated in the business
banking portfolio
Rakesh Jha:
Lending rate will be in a wide range. It will not really be helpful. To the best of the
customers the rate can go as low as 7%. We also do a bit of unsecured there, overdraft
and all where the rates will be well in double digits. So, it's a wide range per se.
Jai Mundra:
On general insurance arm, now that we have gone below I think 48% or 49% What is the
way forward? What is your view on the Bank stake there?
Page 19 of 28Rakesh Jha:
As we have disclosed earlier that banks cannot hold between 30% and 50%. Either you
have to hold more than 50% or you have to hold below 30%. We have got an exemption
from the government through recommendation of RBI to hold between 30% and 50% till
September of 2023. So, in the interim, we would need to reduce our shareholding to 30%
in ICICI General. So, that would happen through any of the means available or we could
also always request for an extension of that period.
