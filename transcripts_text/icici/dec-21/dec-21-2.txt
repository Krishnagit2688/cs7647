Page 1 of 28now hand the conference over to Mr. Sandeep Bakhshi -- Managing Director and CEO of
ICICI Bank. Thank you and over to you, sir.
Sandeep Bakhshi:
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q3 of FY2022. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra,
Rakesh and Anindya.
We hope that you are safe and in good health.
The Bank’s Ultra Frequency Index, comprising several high frequency indicators tracked
by our Economic Research Group rose from 110.3 in end-October to 117.6 in December,
indicating a sustained improvement in economic activity. This was on the back of
improvement in indicators such as power demand, rail freight revenues, e-way bill
generation and labour force participation. While there has been a sharp rise in Covid-19
cases in recent weeks, the impact of the third wave has been mild so far. Vaccination
coverage has continued to increase and the Government of India has recently expanded
the vaccination programme to the age bracket of 15 to 18 and announced a precautionary
third dose of vaccine for identified categories. While the trajectory of the pandemic is still
evolving and the recent increase in cases has slowed the pace of economic activities in
January, we expect the economy to regain momentum as this wave abates. We would like
to thank the medical and health workers’ fraternity for their tireless effort in this fight
against Covid-19.
At ICICI Bank, we aim to create holistic value propositions for our customers through our
360-degree customer-centric approach and focus on opportunities across client and
segment ecosystems. Our cross-functional teams seek to tap into key customer and
market segments, enabling 360-degree coverage of customers and increase in wallet
share. We aim to steadily grow our business within our strategic framework and
strengthen our franchise, delivery, and servicing capabilities, backed by a range of digital
initiatives.
Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:
Page 2 of 28First- Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
the focused pursuit of target market segments.
The core operating profit increased by 24.9% year-on-year to 100.60 billion Rupees in this
quarter. The profit after tax grew by 25.4% year-on-year to 61.94 billion Rupees in this
quarter.
Second-Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Growth in deposits was 16.4% year-on-year at December 31, 2021. During the quarter,
average current account deposits increased by 33.7% year-on-year and average savings
account deposits by 24.7% year-on-year. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was
130%, reflecting continued surplus liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among
the lowest in the system.
Third-Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and reward
The retail loan portfolio grew by 18.6% year-on-year and 5.1% sequentially at December
31, 2021. Disbursements across various retail products increased or were at a similar level
compared to the previous quarter. The business banking portfolio grew by 38.5% year-
on-year and 8.8% sequentially at December 31, 2021. The SME portfolio grew by 34.2%
year-on-year and 9.7% sequentially.
The growth in the domestic corporate portfolio was 12.5% year-on-year and 9.0%
sequentially at December 31, 2021. The growth was driven by disbursements to well-rated
corporates and in line with our risk framework.
The domestic loan portfolio grew by 17.9% year-on-year and 6.5% sequentially. The
overall loan portfolio grew by 16.4% year-on-year and 6.4% sequentially at December 31,
2021.
Fourth-Leveraging digital across our business
Our digital platforms are continuously evolving with the objective of creating end-to-end
seamless digital journeys, offering personalised solutions and value added features to
customers and enabling more effective data-driven cross-sell and up-sell. Our open
architecture based mobile banking app, iMobile Pay, offers a wide variety of products,
Page 3 of 28services and features and helps us to acquire new customers. The growth in our SME and
business banking portfolios has been driven by our digital offerings and platforms like
InstaBIZ and Merchant Stack. Our solutions for corporates comprising our various modular
platforms, and our extensive client coverage have supported the growth in our average
current account deposits. Process decongestion across products and customer segments
is a key element of our strategy. We had made detailed presentations on these areas at
our analyst day in December and have shared some details in slides 18 to 31 of the investor
presentation.
Fifth - Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
Net NPAs declined by 10.0% sequentially to 73.44 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021
from 81.61 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021. The net NPA ratio declined to 0.85% at
December 31, 2021 from 0.99% at September 30, 2021. During the quarter, there were net
deletions from gross NPAs of 1.91 billion Rupees, excluding write-offs and sale. The total
provisions during the quarter were 20.07 billion Rupees or 20.0% of core operating profit
and 1.01% of average advances. The provision coverage ratio on NPAs was 79.9% at
December 31, 2021. In addition, the Bank continues to hold Covid-19 provisions of 64.25
billion Rupees or about 0.8% of total loans as of December 31, 2021.
Sixth- Maintaining a strong capital base
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.64% at
December 31, 2021, including profits for 9M of 2022. The Tier 1 ratio was 18.81% and the
total capital adequacy ratio was 19.79% at December 31, 2021. Further, the market value
of the Bank’s investments in listed entities of the Group is about 940 billion Rupees.
Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to grow our core operating profit in a risk-
calibrated manner. We are reimagining customer journeys with personalised and omni-
channel experiences. Our ecosystem-based approach helps our customers to manage
their business across the value chain efficiently, and has created new opportunities for us
across businesses. We are investing in analytics capabilities and technology to enhance
our offerings to customers and to build a robust future-ready architecture. We continue to
be guided by the twin principles of “One Bank, One RoE”, emphasising the goal of
maximizing our share of target market across all products and services and “Fair to
Customer, Fair to Bank”, emphasising the need to deliver fair value to customers while
Page 4 of 28creating value for shareholders. We remain focused on delivering consistent and
predictable returns to our shareholders. I now hand the call over to Rakesh.
Rakesh Jha:
Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details, growth
in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.
A. Balance sheet growth
Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Coming to the growth across
retail products, the mortgage portfolio grew by 23.3% year-on-year, rural loans by 9.4%
and auto loans by 11.9%. The commercial vehicles and equipment portfolio declined by
2.8% year-on-year. Growth in the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 25.3% year-
on-year. This portfolio was 797.63 billion Rupees or 9.8% of the overall loan book at
December 31, 2021.
The overseas loan portfolio declined by 5.5% year-on-year and grew by 5.1% sequentially
at December 31, 2021. The sequential increase in the overseas loan portfolio was primarily
due to increase in the India-linked trade finance book. The overseas loan portfolio was
5.0% of the overall loan book at December 31, 2021. The non-India linked corporate
portfolio reduced by 57.8% or about 941 million US Dollars year-on-year and 15.8% or
about 129 million US Dollars sequentially, at December 31, 2021. We have provided the
breakup of our overseas corporate portfolio on slide 16 of the investor presentation.
Coming to the funding side: average savings account deposits increased by 24.7% year-
on-year and 5.2% sequentially. Average current account deposits increased by 33.7%
year-on-year and 11.9% sequentially. This quarter the flows related to IPOs and capital
markets were high and contributed to the average current account balances. Total term
deposits grew by 12.1% year-on-year to 5.4 trillion Rupees at December 31, 2021.
B. Credit quality
During the quarter, there were net deletions from gross NPAs of 1.91 billion Rupees
compared to net additions of 0.96 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There were net
additions of 1.26 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the retail and business banking portfolios
and net deletions of 3.17 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the corporate and SME portfolios.
Page 5 of 28The gross NPA additions declined to 40.18 billion Rupees in the current quarter from 72.31
billion Rupees in Q1 and 55.78 billion Rupees in Q2 this year. The gross NPA additions
from the retail and business banking portfolio were 38.53 billion Rupees and from the
corporate and SME portfolio were 1.65 billion Rupees. There were gross NPA additions of
about 6.14 billion Rupees from the kisan credit card portfolio in the current quarter. We
typically see higher NPA additions from the kisan credit card portfolio in the first and third
quarter of a fiscal year.
Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs, excluding write-offs and sale, were 42.09 billion
Rupees. There were recoveries and upgrades of 37.27 billion Rupees from the retail and
business banking portfolio and 4.82 billion Rupees from the corporate and SME portfolio.
The gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 40.88 billion Rupees. The Bank sold
gross NPAs amounting to 1.05 billion Rupees in Q3 of 2022 on a cash basis.
The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 36.38
billion Rupees as of December 31, 2021 compared to 37.14 billion Rupees at September
30, 2021. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 19.57 billion Rupees as of December
31, 2021 on this non-fund based outstanding.
The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers, under resolution as per various
guidelines was 96.84 billion Rupees or about 1.2% of the total loan portfolio at December
31, 2021. Of the total fund based outstanding under resolution at December 31, 2021, 64.74
billion Rupees was from the retail and business banking portfolio and 32.10 billion Rupees
was from the corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 24.36 billion
Rupees against these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI
guidelines. Over 95% of the loans under resolution in the retail and business banking
portfolio are secured loans.
C. P&L Details
Net interest income increased by 23.4% year-on-year to 122.36 billion Rupees. Interest on
income tax refund was 1.81 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 0.30 billion Rupees in
the previous quarter and 1.96 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. The net interest margin was
at 3.96% in this quarter compared to 4.00% in the previous quarter and 3.67% in Q3 of
last year. The impact of interest on income tax refund on net interest margin was 6 bps in
Q3 of this year compared to 1 bps in the previous quarter and 7 bps in Q3 of last year. The
Page 6 of 28domestic NIM was at 4.06% this quarter compared to 4.09% in previous quarter and 3.78%
in Q3 last year. Overseas margins were at 0.28%. The cost of deposits was 3.47% in Q3
compared to 3.53% in Q2. The sequential decline in net interest margin during the quarter
was mainly due to decline in yield on advances, partly offset by decline in cost of deposits
and higher interest on income tax refund. Of the total domestic loans, interest rates on
38% are linked to repo rate and 7% to other external benchmarks.
Non-interest income, excluding treasury income, grew by 24.9% year-on-year to 48.99
billion Rupees in Q3 of 2022
 Fee income increased by 19.2% year-on-year to 42.91 billion Rupees in Q3 driven by
growth across various segments. Fees from retail, business banking and SME
customers grew by 16.3% year-on-year and constituted about 76% of the total fees in
this quarter.
 Dividend income from subsidiaries and listed entities was 6.03 billion Rupees in this
quarter compared to 3.56 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. The dividend income this
quarter includes interim dividend of ICICI General and higher interim dividend from
ICICI Securities and ICICI AMC compared to Q3 of last year.
On Costs: The Bank’s operating expenses increased by 22.4% year-on-year in Q3 partially
reflecting the slightly lower base of Q3 last year. The employee expenses increased by
27.4% year-on-year. The Bank had about 102,000 employees at December 31, 2021. The
employee count has increased by about 9,900 in the last 12 months. Employee expenses
in Q3 include an impact of about 0.69 billion Rupees due to fair valuation of ESOPs granted
to all employees post April 1, 2021 for the current quarter as required by RBI guidelines.
Non-employee expenses increased by 19.9% year-on-year in this quarter primarily due to
retail business and technology related expenses. We continue to invest in technology to
enhance our offerings to customers as well as the scalability, flexibility and resilience of
our technology architecture. The technology expenses were about 8.4% of our operating
expenses in 9M of 2022.
The core operating profit increased by 24.9% year-on-year and 5.7% sequentially to 100.60
billion Rupees in this quarter.
Page 7 of 28There was a treasury gain of 0.88 billion Rupees in Q3 compared to 3.97 billion Rupees in
Q2 and 7.66 billion Rupees in Q3 of the previous year. Treasury income in Q3 of last year
included gains of 3.29 billion Rupees from sale of shares of ICICI Securities.
The total provisions during the quarter were 20.07 billion Rupees or 20.0% of core
operating profit and 1.01% of average advances. The provisions this quarter include 4.65
billion Rupees of higher provision against security receipts and 4.47 billion Rupees of
higher provision on loans under resolution on a prudent basis. There was no writeback of
Covid-19 related provisions during the quarter. The provisioning coverage on NPAs
continued to be robust at 79.9% as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we hold 24.36 billion
Rupees of provisions on borrowers under resolution and Covid-19 related provisions of
64.25 billion Rupees. The Covid-19 provisions are about 0.8% of loans. At December 31,
2021, the total provisions, other than specific provisions on NPAs, were 160.26 billion
Rupees or 2.0% of loans.
The profit before tax grew by 33.9% year-on-year to 81.41 billion Rupees in this quarter
from 60.78 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year. The tax expense was 19.47 billion Rupees in
this quarter compared to 11.38 billion Rupees in the corresponding quarter last year. The
profit after tax grew by 25.4% year-on-year to 61.94 billion Rupees in this quarter
compared to 49.40 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year.
The consolidated profit after tax was 65.36 billion Rupees this quarter compared to 54.98
billion Rupees in Q3 of last year.
D. Growth in digital offerings
Leveraging digital and technology across businesses is a key element of our strategy of
growing the risk calibrated core operating profit. We have seen significant increase in the
adoption of our mobile banking app, iMobile Pay. There have been 5.3 million activations
of iMobile Pay by non-ICICI Bank account holders as of end-December. The value of
transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders grew by 73% sequentially in Q3 of 2022.
The value of credit card spends in Q3-2022 was 2.2 times the value of credit card spends
in Q3-2021 and grew by 27% sequentially.
Page 8 of 28The value of financial transactions on InstaBIZ grew by about 68% year-on-year in the
current quarter. The value of transactions on the supply chain platforms in the current
quarter was 3.5 times the value of transactions in Q3 last year.
The proportion of end-to-end digital sanctions and disbursements across various products
has been increasing steadily. About 33% of our mortgage sanctions and 43% of our
personal loan disbursements, by volume, were end-to-end digital in 9M of 2022. About
95% of the overdraft facilities set up for business banking current account customers were
end-to-end digital in 9M of 2022.
The Bank had launched ICICI STACK for corporates and has created more than 20 industry
specific STACKs which provide bespoke and purpose-based digital solutions to corporate
clients and their ecosystems. The volume of transactions through these solutions in Q3-
2022 was 3.7 times the volume of tranasctions in Q3-2021.
The Bank recently launched TradeEmerge for importers and exporters across India,
offering banking as well as value-added services. This initiative makes cross border trade
hassle-free, quick and convenient, as it offers an array of services in one place.
E. Portfolio information
We have been growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward. Our retail portfolio has been built based on proprietary data and analytics in
addition to bureau checks, utilising the existing customer database for sourcing in key
retail asset products through cross sell and up-sell and pricing in relation to the risk. In the
business banking and SME business, our focus is on parameterised and programme based
lending, granularity, collateral and robust monitoring. We have given further information
on our retail and business banking portfolio in slides 42 to 45 of our investor presentation.
The loan and non-fund based outstanding to performing corporate and SME borrowers
rated BB and below was 118.42 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021 compared to 127.14
billion Rupees at September 30, 2021. The amount of 118.42 billion Rupees at December
31, 2021 includes 27.97 billion Rupee of loans under resolution. The details are given on
slide 40 and 41 of the investor presentation.
Page 9 of 28Similar to the last quarter, other than three accounts, one each in construction, power and
telecom sectors, the maximum single borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio
was less than 6 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, we held
provisions of 15.75 billion Rupees on the BB and below portfolio compared to 9.60 billion
Rupees at September 30, 2021. This includes provisions held against borrowers under
resolution included in this portfolio.
The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans
and working capital loans was 257.53 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021 compared to
228.14 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021. The builder portfolio is about 3% of our total
loan portfolio. Our portfolio is granular in nature with the larger exposures being to well-
established builders and this is also reflected in the sequential increase in the portfolio.
About 11% of our builder portfolio at December 31, 2021 was either rated BB and below
internally or was classified as non-performing, compared to 13% at September 30, 2021.
The total outstanding to NBFCs and HFCs was 675.86 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021
compared to 605.11 billion Rupees at September 30, 2021. The total outstanding loans to
NBFCs and HFCs were about 7% of our advances at December 31, 2021. The details are
given on slide 47 of the investor presentation. The sequential increase in the outstanding
to NBFCs and HFCs is mainly due to disbursements to PSU entities, entities having long
vintage and owned by banks and well-established corporate groups. The proportion of the
NBFC and HFC portfolio internally rated BB and below or non-performing is less than 0.4%
as of December 31, 2021.
F. Subsidiaries and key associates
The details of the financial performance of subsidiaries and key associates is covered in
slides 52 to 54 and slides 73 to 78 in the investor presentation.
The new business premium of ICICI Life grew by 29.7% year-on-year to 102.48 billion
Rupees in 9M this year. The VNB margin increased from 25.1% in FY2021 to 27.1% in 9M
this year. The value of new business increased by 34.8% year-on-year to 13.88 billion
Rupees in 9M this year. The profit after tax of ICICI Life was 5.69 billion Rupees in 9M this
year compared to 8.96 billion Rupees in 9M of last year. ICICI Life had a net loss of 1.86
billion Rupees in Q1 this year primarily because of Covid-19 claims and provisions made
Page 10 of 28for incurred but not reported claims. The profit after tax was 3.11 billion Rupees in this
quarter compared to 3.06 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year.
Gross Direct Premium Income of ICICI General was 133.11 billion Rupees in 9M this year
compared to 105.25 billion Rupees in 9M last year. The combined ratio was 111.0% in 9M
of this year compared to 99.1% in 9M last year. The profit after tax was 3.18 billion Rupees
this quarter compared to 3.14 billion Rupees in Q3 last year. Prior period numbers are not
comparable due to the reflection of the general insurance business of Bharti AXA in the
current period numbers.
The profit after tax of ICICI AMC was 3.34 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 3.58
billion Rupees in Q3 of last year.
The profit after tax of ICICI Securities, on a consolidated basis, increased by 42.3% year-
on-year to 3.80 billion Rupees in this quarter from 2.67 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year.
ICICI Bank Canada had a profit after tax of 11.5 million Canadian dollars in this quarter
compared to 5.1 million Canadian dollars in Q3 last year and 8.4 million Canadian dollars
in Q2 this year. The sequential increase in profit after tax of ICICI Bank Canada is mainly
due to writeback of provisions. The loan book of ICICI Bank Canada at December 31, 2021
declined by 4.8% year-on-year. ICICI Bank Canada has repatriated CAD 220 million of
equity capital to ICICI Bank in January 2022.
ICICI Bank UK had a profit after tax of 3.0 million US dollars this quarter compared to 2.2
million US dollars in Q3 of last year and 2.0 million US dollars in Q2 this year. The loan
book of ICICI Bank UK at December 31, 2021 declined by 21.3% year-on-year and 2.2%
sequentially.
As per Ind AS, ICICI Home Finance had a profit after tax of 0.48 billion Rupees in the current
quarter compared to 0.03 billion Rupees in Q3 of last year and 0.46 billion Rupees in Q2
this year. The year-on-year increase in profit after tax is mainly due to decline in cost of
funds and lower provisions.
With this, we conclude our opening remarks and we will now be happy to take your
questions.
