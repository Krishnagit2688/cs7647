The next question is from the line of Naishi Shah from Acko General Insurance. Please go
ahead.
Naishi Shah:
I'm just confused about one of the data points that is shared. You said that net deletions of
Rs. 1.9 billion from gross NPA and you clarified that this is not write-off. So, then could
you please explain what this number is?
Rakesh Jha:
The gross addition to NPAs was about Rs 40.18 billion. That is the fresh slippages during
the quarter and we had deletions, upgrades, recoveries of Rs. 42.09 billion where we
would have either recovered the loans in full or we would have recovered the overdue
amount in full so, the account would have got upgraded. So, the Rs. 40.18 billion of
addition less the gross deletion of Rs. 42.09 billion is the net addition or reduction in this
case of Rs. 1.91 billion that we refer to. And then thereafter, we have also done write-off
of about Rs. 40 billion.
Naishi Shah:
Also, from the write-off, could you just tell me how much was from the restructuring book?
Rakesh Jha:
Write-off from restructuring book would really not be there. We would have seen some
slippages.
Naishi Shah:
What kind of slippages did you see if I may ask?
Page 18 of 28Rakesh Jha:
We have seen some slippages from the restructured portfolio. Of the reduction on the
restructured loans about one-third has been because of slippages, two-thirds has been
recovery. That's the kind of trend that we have seen.
