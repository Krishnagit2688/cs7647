We'll take one last question from Adarsh Parasrampuria from CLSA. Please go ahead.
Adarsh Parasrampuria:
The question is on fees. We did have a bit of clean out on fees, in the sense that we got
choosy on selling insurance, we let go also prepayment charges and all. Just wanted to
understand, is that part of the base or it still takes a little bit time before we get normalcy
growth?
Anindya Banerjee:
I would think maybe in the second half, it is largely part of the base. Insurance of course
is something that has been coming down over the last couple of years, and the other
charges etc., is something that we rationalized through the year. So we should probably
be closer to the base in that.

When I look at the other expenses on ex-employees, it's had a decent growth over the
last couple of years, right, accelerated technology spends. As NIM slows down, is that a
lever or because you had branches and given the profitability is too strong, that should
not be used as an ROE lever?
Anindya Banerjee:
So I think we have consistently said that, we believe that there is a good market
opportunity for us, and we will continue to invest in that, and if for a couple of quarters,
operating expenses growth is higher than revenue growth, we would not really worry
about it too much as long as we have a have a sustainable path. So we'll have to just
look through that.
