We have a next question from the line of Saurabh S Kumar from JP Morgan. Please go
ahead.
Saurabh S Kumar:
So, this 75%, 80% recovery rate that is seen on the retail business, that you think normal
or just sort of COVID where we are just experiencing a strong momentum. I'm just asking
that your gross number is maybe two and a half percent and net is extremely low, if net
number is sustainable is the question?

I think we have always been saying that the net additions in retail will go up and they
have actually gone up. But probably if you look at the gross additions and gross deletions
for the quarter, the deletions which are accounted for by very old NPAs would not be
much. In fact, now, we have, in addition to pretty accelerated provisioning, we have fairly
accelerated write-offs as well. So, I think, deletions is I would say not abnormal. But,
having said that, as the portfolio grows and seasons, we will see an increase in the net
additions as well.
Saurabh S Kumar:
Second one is on RIDF. So your reduction which we have seen year-on-year is mostly
done?
Anindya Banerjee:
This is basically the net maturity. So we have had more majorities of our RIDF investment
than the incremental investments that we have been called upon to make.
Saurabh S Kumar:
So, incrementally, you must be meeting the requirements even at this growth. Will that
be a fair comment?
Anindya Banerjee:
We do meet the overall requirement. We have some shortfalls in a couple of the
subcategories. And we do have some RIDF calls as well. But those are quite moderate
and the maturity out of the past yearsâ€™ RIDF portfolio has exceeded that.
