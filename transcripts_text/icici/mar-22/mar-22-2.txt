ICICI Bank. Thank you and over to you, sir.
Mr. Bakhshi’s opening remarks
Good evening to all of you and welcome to the ICICI Bank Earnings Call to discuss the
results for Q4 of FY2022. Joining us today on this call are Vishakha, Anup, Sandeep Batra,
Rakesh and Anindya.
We hope that you are safe and in good health.
In January we saw a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases that resulted in a
moderation in the pace of economic activity. However, the impact of this third wave of the
pandemic was mild and with the decline in number of new Covid-19 cases, economic
activity gained momentum in the months of February and March. This was visible in the
Bank’s Ultra Frequency Index, comprising several high frequency indicators tracked by our
Economic Research Group, which rose from 112.0 in January to 114.9 in February and
124.4 in March. Some of the major factors leading to improvement in this index were
increase in power demand, rail freight revenues, e-way bill generation and GST
collections. We extend our gratitude to the medical and health workers’ fraternity for their
tireless effort in this fight against Covid-19.
At ICICI Bank, we aim to grow the core operating profit within the guardrails of compliance
and risk through our 360-degree customer-centric approach and focus on opportunities
across client and segment ecosystems. We focus on growing our loan portfolio in a
granular manner with a focus on risk and reward, with return of capital and containment
of provisions below a defined percentage of core operating profit being a key imperative.
We follow a micro market based approach to create an efficient distribution and resource
allocation strategy by using analytics to identify opportunities. We aim to steadily grow
our business within our strategic framework and strengthen our franchise, delivery, and
servicing capabilities, backed by a range of digital initiatives.
Page 2 of 26Coming to the quarterly performance against this framework:
First- Growth in the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner through
the focused pursuit of target market segments
The core operating profit increased by 18.7% year-on-year to 101.64 billion Rupees in this
quarter and 22.3% year-on-year to 383.47 billion Rupees in FY2022. Excluding dividend
income from subsidiaries and associates, core operating profit grew by 21.0% year-on-
year in Q4 of 2022. The profit after tax grew by 59.4% year-on-year to 70.19 billion Rupees
in this quarter. For the fiscal year 2022, the profit after tax increased by 44.1% year-on-
year to 233.39 billion Rupees. The Board has recommended a dividend of 5 Rupees per
share for FY2022, subject to requisite approvals.
Second-Further enhancing our strong deposit franchise
Total deposits grew by 14.2% year-on-year at March 31, 2022. During the quarter, average
current account deposits increased by 23.6% year-on-year and average savings account
deposits by 22.7% year-on-year. The liquidity coverage ratio for the quarter was about
130%, reflecting continued surplus liquidity. Our cost of deposits continues to be among
the lowest in the system.
Third-Growing our loan portfolio in a granular manner with a focus on risk and
reward
The retail loan portfolio, excluding rural loans, grew by 19.7% year-on-year and 6.0%
sequentially at March 31, 2022. Disbursements across various retail products increased in
Q4 of 2022 compared to the previous quarter. The business banking portfolio grew by

33.6% year-on-year and 11.3% sequentially. The growth in our SME and business banking
portfolios has been driven by our digital offerings and platforms like InstaBIZ and Merchant
Stack.
The domestic corporate portfolio grew by 9.7% year-on-year and was flat sequentially at
March 31, 2022. The domestic loan portfolio grew by 17.5% year-on-year and 5.7%
Page 3 of 26sequentially. The overall loan portfolio grew by 17.1% year-on-year and 5.5% sequentially
at March 31, 2022.
Fourth-Leveraging digital across our business
Our various digital platforms such as iMobile Pay, internet banking platforms, InstaBIZ and
Trade Online provide end-to-end seamless digital journeys, personalised solutions and
value added features to customers and enable more data driven cross sell and up sell. In
line with the philosophy of open architecture, of our digital platforms, recently, we made
our InstaBIZ app interoperable, that is, all benefits of the app are now available to all
merchants including those who do not have a current account with us. This initiative
enables merchants to instantly create digital collection solutions like UPI ID and QR code
and start collecting money from their customers. We have shared some details on our
technology and digital offerings in slides 18 to 32 of the investor presentation.
Fifth - Protecting the balance sheet from potential risks
Net NPAs declined by 24.2% year-on-year and 5.2% sequentially to 69.61 billion Rupees
at March 31, 2022 from 73.44 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021. The net NPA ratio
declined to 0.76% at March 31, 2022 from 0.85% at December 31, 2021. During the quarter,
there were net deletions from gross NPAs of 4.89 billion Rupees, excluding write-offs and
sale. The provision coverage ratio on NPAs was 79.2% at March 31, 2022. The total
provisions during the quarter were 10.69 billion Rupees or 10.5% of core operating profit
and 0.53% of average advances. This includes contingency provision of 10.25 billion made
on a prudent basis. The Bank holds contingency provisions of 74.50 billion Rupees or
about 0.9% of total loans as of March 31, 2022.
Sixth- Maintaining a strong capital base
The capital position of the Bank continued to be strong with a CET-1 ratio of 17.60% at
March 31, 2022 after reckoning the impact of the proposed dividend. The Tier 1 ratio was
18.35% and the total capital adequacy ratio was 19.16% at March 31, 2022. Further, the
market value of the Bank’s investments in listed entities of the Group is about 840 billion
Rupees.
Page 4 of 26As has been announced, Vishakha has decided to pursue opportunities outside the Group
and will step down from the Board effective May 31. We thank her for her outstanding
contribution to ICICI and wish her all the very best. Anup would take over Vishakha’s
responsibilities at the Board level. The Board has today approved the elevation of Rakesh
as an Executive Director and he would take over Anup’s responsibilities. Anindya will take
up the role of CFO and will report to Sandeep who will continue to head our Corporate
Centre.
At ICICI Bank, we strive to build a sustainable and responsible business and make a
positive impact on the economy, society and environment. The Bank has focused on
various aspects of ESG in its business as well as CSR activities. We have adopted a Board
approved ESG Policy along with a governance and oversight framework for ESG.
Looking ahead, we see many opportunities to grow our core operating profit in a risk-
calibrated manner. We will continue to focus on our objective of catering to all the banking
and financial needs of the customer with a focus on risk and reward. Our ecosystem based
approach and creation of multi-functional teams has helped in nurturing relationships and
offering the entire bouquet of services of the Bank to customers. We continue to be guided
by the twin principles of “One Bank, One RoE”, emphasising the goal of maximising our
share of target market across all products and services and “Fair to Customer, Fair to
Bank”, emphasising the need to deliver fair value to customers while creating value for
shareholders. We remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable returns to our
shareholders.
I now hand the call over to Rakesh.
Page 5 of 26Rakesh’s opening remarks
Thank you, Sandeep. I will talk about balance sheet growth, credit quality, P&L details,
growth in digital offerings, portfolio trends and performance of subsidiaries.
A. Balance sheet growth
Sandeep covered the loan growth across various segments. Up to the last quarter, we
used to report rural loans as a part of the retail portfolio. From this quarter, we are reporting
rural separately. The retail loan portfolio, excluding rural loans, grew by 19.7% year-on-
year and 6.0% sequentially at March 31, 2022. Coming to the growth across retail products,
the mortgage portfolio grew by 20.3% year-on-year, and auto loans by 11.3%. The
commercial vehicles and equipment portfolio declined by 1.3% year-on-year. Growth in
the personal loan and credit card portfolio was 31.9% year-on-year. This portfolio was
879.35 billion Rupees or 10.2% of the overall loan book at March 31, 2022. The rural loan
portfolio increased by 6.5% year-on-year and 4.3% sequentially. The retail and rural
portfolio together grew by 17.6% year-on-year and 5.8% sequentially.
The overseas loan portfolio, in US dollar terms, grew by 5.9% year-on-year and was flat
sequentially at March 31, 2022. The year-on-year increase in the overseas loan portfolio
was primarily due to increase in the India-linked trade finance book. The overseas loan
portfolio was 4.8% of the overall loan book at March 31, 2022. The non-India linked
corporate portfolio reduced by 48.2% or about 597 million US Dollars year-on-year and
6.8% or about 47 million US Dollars sequentially. Of the overseas corporate portfolio,
about 82% comprises Indian corporates, 10% is overseas corporates with Indian linkage,
4% comprises companies owned by NRIs or PIOs and balance 4% is non-India corporates.
Our direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is negligible. We have exposure to an Indian oil
refinery rated AA- externally where a sanctioned Russian entity owns 49% stake. The
exposure is largely non-fund in nature. The oil refinery’s operations are largely in India.
Coming to the funding side: average savings account deposits increased by 22.7% year-
on-year in Q4 and 23.5% year-on-year in FY2022. Average current account deposits
increased by 23.6% year-on-year in Q4 and 31.0% year-on-year in FY2022. Total term
deposits grew by 9.0% year-on-year at March 31, 2022.
Page 6 of 26B. Credit quality
The net deletions from gross NPAs were 4.89 billion Rupees in the current quarter
compared to 1.91 billion Rupees in the previous quarter. There were net additions of 1.23
billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the retail, rural and business banking portfolios and net
deletions of 6.12 billion Rupees to gross NPAs in the corporate and SME portfolios.
The gross NPA additions were 42.04 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to
40.18 in the previous quarter. The gross NPA additions from the retail, rural and business
banking portfolio were 37.36 billion Rupees and from the corporate and SME portfolio
were 4.68 billion Rupees. Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs, excluding write-offs and
sale, were 46.93 billion Rupees in the current quarter compared to 42.09 billion Rupees in
the previous quarter. There were recoveries and upgrades of 36.13 billion Rupees from
the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 10.80 billion Rupees from the corporate
and SME portfolio. Corporate and SME recoveries and upgrades include a power sector
account which was upgraded post implementation of a resolution plan under IBC. The
gross NPAs written-off during the quarter were 26.44 billion Rupees.
The non-fund based outstanding to borrowers classified as non-performing was 36.40
billion Rupees as of March 31, 2022 compared to 36.38 billion Rupees as of December 31,
2021. The Bank holds provisions amounting to 20.51 billion Rupees as of March 31, 2022
against this non-fund based outstanding.
The total fund based outstanding to all standard borrowers, under resolution as per
various guidelines declined to 82.67 billion Rupees or about 1.0% of the total loan portfolio
at March 31, 2022 from 96.84 billion Rupees as of December 31, 2021. The sequential
decline was mainly due to prepayment by a borrower in the construction sector. Of the
total fund based outstanding under resolution at March 31, 2022, 60.43 billion Rupees was
from the retail, rural and business banking portfolio and 22.24 billion Rupees was from the
corporate and SME portfolio. The Bank holds provisions of 25.30 billion Rupees against
these borrowers, which is higher than the requirement as per RBI guidelines.

due to fair valuation of ESOPs granted to all employees post April 1, 2021 for the current
quarter as required by RBI guidelines. Non-employee expenses increased by 15.6% year-
on-year in this quarter primarily due to retail business and technology related expenses.

this quarter. The consolidated profit after tax grew by 36.6% year-on-year to 251.10 billion

D. Growth in digital offerings
Leveraging digital and technology across businesses is a key element of our strategy of
growing the risk calibrated core operating profit. We have seen significant increase in the
adoption of our mobile banking app, iMobile Pay. There have been 6.3 million activations
of iMobile Pay by non-ICICI Bank account holders as of end-March. The value of
transactions by non-ICICI Bank account holders in the current quarter was 4.9 times the
value of transactions in Q3 of 2022.
Page 9 of 26The value of credit card spends grew by 77% year-on-year in Q4 of 2022 driven by higher
activation rate through digital onboarding of customers, including Amazon Pay credit
cards, automated and effective portfolio management to grow spends among existing
card customers and diversification through commercial cards. The Bank has issued more
than 3 million Amazon Pay credit cards since its launch. The Bank has recently tied up with
Emirates Skywards, the award-winning loyalty programme of Emirates and FlyDubai, to
launch a range of co-branded credit cards that enable customers to earn reward points on
travel, lifestyle and everyday spends.
The value of financial transactions on InstaBIZ grew by about 44% year-on-year in the
current quarter. The value of transactions on the supply chain platforms in the current
quarter was 2.7 times the value of transactions in Q4 last year.
The proportion of end-to-end digital sanctions and disbursements across various products
has been increasing steadily. About 34% of our mortgage sanctions and 44% of our
personal loan disbursements, by volume, were end-to-end digital in FY2022.
The Bank has created more than 20 industry specific STACKs which provide bespoke and
purpose-based digital solutions to corporate clients and their ecosystems. The volume of
transactions through these solutions in FY2022 was 2.7 times the volume of transactions
in FY2021. The value of transactions done on Trade Online increased by about 80% year-
on-year in FY2022.
E. Portfolio information

46 of the investor presentation.

rated BB and below was 108.08 billion Rupees at March 31, 2022 compared to 118.42
billion Rupees at December 31, 2021. The amount of 108.08 billion Rupees at March 31,
2022 includes 23.89 billion Rupee of loans under resolution. The sequential decline during
the quarter was mainly due to prepayment from a borrower in the construction sector
Page 10 of 26where resolution had been implemented as per RBI’s Covid resolution framework. The
details are given on slide 41 and 42 of the investor presentation.
Other than two accounts one each in power and telecom sectors, the maximum single
borrower outstanding in the BB and below portfolio was less than 6 billion Rupees at
March 31, 2022. At March 31, 2022, we held provisions of 12.32 billion Rupees on the BB
and below portfolio compared to 15.75 billion Rupees at December 31, 2021. This includes
provisions held against borrowers under resolution included in this portfolio.
The builder portfolio including construction finance, lease rental discounting, term loans
and working capital loans was 269.48 billion Rupees at March 31, 2022 compared to 257.53
billion Rupees at December 31, 2021. The builder portfolio is about 3% of our total loan
portfolio. Our portfolio is granular in nature with the larger exposures being to well-
established builders and this is also reflected in the sequential increase in the portfolio.
About 9.5% of our builder portfolio at March 31, 2022 was either rated BB and below
internally or was classified as non-performing, compared to 11% at December 31, 2021.

this quarter compared to 3.46 billion Rupees in Q4 last year. Prior period numbers are not
Page 11 of 26comparable due to the reflection of the general insurance business of Bharti AXA in the
current period numbers.
The profit after tax of ICICI AMC was 3.57 billion Rupees in this quarter compared to 3.48
billion Rupees in Q4 of last year.
The profit after tax of ICICI Securities, on a consolidated basis, increased by 3% year-on-
year to 3.40 billion Rupees in this quarter from 3.29 billion Rupees in Q4 of last year.
ICICI Bank Canada had a profit after tax of 4.3 million Canadian dollars in this quarter
compared to 5.1 million Canadian dollars in Q4 last year and 11.5 million Canadian dollars
in Q3 this year. Profit after tax was higher in Q4 last year and Q3 this year due to write-
back of provisions. ICICI Bank Canada repatriated CAD 220 million of equity capital to ICICI
Bank in Q4 this year.
ICICI Bank UK had a profit after tax of 3.1 million US dollars this quarter compared to 2.8
million US dollars in Q4 of last year and 3.0 million US dollars in Q3 this year.
As per Ind AS, ICICI Home Finance had a profit after tax of 0.53 billion Rupees in the current
quarter compared to 0.15 billion Rupees in Q4 of last year and 0.48 billion Rupees in Q3
this year. The year-on-year increase in profit after tax is mainly due to decline in cost of
funds and lower provisions.
With this, we conclude our opening remarks and we will now be happy to take your
questions.
