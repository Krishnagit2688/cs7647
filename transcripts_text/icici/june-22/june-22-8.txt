The next question is from the line of Ashish Sharma from ENAM AMC. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sharma:
Sir, 2 questions. One on the credit cost. We have created another contingent provision in
this quarter, but we've seen one peer bank sort of writing back the provision they made in
relation to the COVID. So, sir, some color on how we see the credit cost, given our strategy
of sort of creating contingent provision? Second question would be on the credit card
portfolio. If you can, sir, sort of give some color on the revolver book. I mean has it picked
up? That would be helpful.
Anindya Banerjee:
I think we made this contingency provision on a prudent basis. Clearly, as you would have
seen the numbers in terms of the net additions as well as the net provisions, the numbers
are very low. But at the same time, there are potential headwinds in the environment given
what is happening on inflation and rates and potentially a sharp slowdown in growth in
major economies and so on. So, given that, although the current trends are benign, we
looked at our portfolio and decided to add to our contingency buffer to strengthen the
balance sheet, which is a key element of our strategic framework that Sandeep also spoke
about. So, that is how we looked at it. I think we'll have to see how the credit cost trajectory
evolves in future. On the revolver, of course, compared to pre-pandemic levels, revolver
rates had come down, and we hope that they would now start moving up as spends also
pick up.
